# Platform Identity Architecture (kombifySphere / SaaS)

> Identity, multi-tenancy, and federation for the kombify cloud platform.

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-11
**Scope**: This document covers the identity model for the **kombify SaaS platform** — kombifySphere, kombifyAPI, multi-tenancy, and cloud ↔ homelab federation. For the identity stack **within homelabs** (deployed by StackKits), see [IDENTITY-STACKKITS.md](IDENTITY-STACKKITS.md).

> **Status**: Planning phase. The SaaS platform IdP has not been finalized. The content below captures architectural intent and constraints.

---

## 1. Context: Where SaaS Identity Meets Homelab Identity

kombify Stack (PocketBase) operates in two modes:

| Mode | Identity Source | How Users Authenticate |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Self-hosted** | PocketID (local OIDC) + LLDAP | Passkeys via PocketID, groups from LLDAP |
| **Cloud/managed** | Platform IdP (TBD) | OIDC via platform IdP, federated to PocketBase |

The self-hosted identity model is fully defined in [IDENTITY-STACKKITS.md](IDENTITY-STACKKITS.md). This document covers the **cloud mode** and the boundary where platform identity meets local identity.

## 2. Platform IdP Decision (Open)

The original plan proposed **Zitadel** as the central SaaS IdP. This remains a candidate but is **not a settled decision**. Alternatives include:

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Zitadel** | Multi-tenant OIDC, FIDO2, rich API | Operational complexity, self-host or cloud dependency |
| **Auth0 / Clerk** | Managed, fast to integrate | Vendor lock-in, cost at scale |
| **PocketID (cloud instance)** | Consistent with homelab stack | Not designed for multi-tenant SaaS |
| **Custom (PocketBase auth)** | Already integrated in kombify Stack | Limited OIDC features, no federation |

**Decision criteria:**
- Must support OIDC with standard claims (roles, groups, org).
- Must support passkeys (WebAuthn) as primary auth.
- Must support multi-tenancy (organizations / projects).
- Must be able to federate with local PocketID instances in homelabs.

**Current implementation**: kombify Stack has working Zitadel OIDC integration (`pkg/auth/zitadel/`) and Kong header trust (`pkg/auth/kong/`). These work but tie the stack to a specific IdP choice.

## 3. Identity Flow: Cloud ↔ Homelab

### User authenticates in cloud mode

```
User → kombifySphere UI → Platform IdP (OIDC login)
                              │
                              ▼
                         OIDC token (with org, role, groups)
                              │
                              ▼
                    kombifyAPI (validates JWT, injects X-User-ID, X-Org-ID)
                              │
                              ▼
                    kombify Stack (PocketBase)
                    → findOrCreateUser(external_id)
                    → maps org roles to local roles
```

### Homelab agents connect to cloud

```
kombify Stack agent (in homelab) → mTLS cert (from Step-CA)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                               kombifyAPI (validates client cert)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                               Maps cert SAN to tenant + homelab instance
```

### Federation: cloud user accesses homelab directly

```
User → Cloudflare Tunnel → Traefik (homelab)
                              │
                              ▼
                         TinyAuth (ForwardAuth)
                              │
                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                    ▼                   ▼
              PocketID (local)    Platform IdP (cloud)
              [local users]       [SaaS users]
                    │                   │
                    └─────────┬─────────┘
                              ▼
                    TinyAuth resolves identity
                    → LLDAP groups for authorization
```

TinyAuth acts as the federation broker: it can accept OIDC tokens from either the local PocketID or the platform IdP, and maps both to LLDAP groups for consistent authorization.

## 4. Role Model Across Tools

### SaaS roles (kombifySphere)

| Role | Scope | Permissions |
|------|-------|------------|
| USER | Organization | Access own homelabs / projects |
| MANAGER | Organization | Billing, team members, plans |
| ADMIN | Organization | Full access at org level |

### Homelab roles (kombify Stack)

| Role | Scope | Permissions |
|------|-------|------------|
| owner | One homelab | Full access |
| operator | One homelab | Deploy, update, monitor, backup |
| developer | One homelab | Deploy, logs, exec |
| viewer | One homelab | Read-only dashboards and logs |

### Internal operations (kombifyAdmin)

| Role | Scope | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| support | Fleet-wide | Read access to tenant data for support |
| ops | Fleet-wide | Operational actions across tenants |

**Mapping rule**: SaaS roles determine **which homelabs** a user can access. Homelab roles determine **what they can do** within a specific homelab. These are separate concerns.

All roles appear as standardized claims (`role`, `org_role`, `lab_role`) in OIDC/JWT tokens.

---

## 5. Multi-Tenancy

### Tenant structure

```
Organization (kombifySphere)
  └── Project / Tenant
        ├── kombify Stack instance (homelab)
        ├── kombify Sim instance (optional)
        └── StackKits catalog (optional)
```

### Tenant isolation

* **kombifyAPI** enforces tenant boundaries via `X-Org-ID` / `tenant_id` in all requests.
* **PocketBase** has `tenant_id` fields on core collections (stacks, nodes, jobs).
* **Database-level isolation**: all queries scoped by `owner_id` or `tenant_id` collection rules.

### Trust domains

| Domain | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| `cloud.kombify.io` | SaaS / kombifySphere / kombifyAPI |
| `homelab.local` or custom | Local kombify Stack instances |
| Per-environment domains | Optional dev / stage / prod split |

---

## 6. Service Accounts & API Clients

### Service accounts per tool

| Service Account | Purpose | Auth Method |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| kombify Stack workers | Execute provisioning jobs | mTLS (Step-CA) |
| kombify Sim orchestrator | Run simulations | mTLS or OAuth2 client credentials |
| CI/CD pipelines | Automated StackKit validation | OAuth2 client credentials |
| Monitoring agents | Push metrics/logs | mTLS |

### Scope model

Fine-grained scopes for API access:
- `stackkits:read`, `stackkits:write`
- `labs:operate`, `labs:read`
- `simulations:run`
- Each automation gets only the minimal required scopes.

### Token lifecycle

* Short-lived access tokens (minutes to hours).
* Certificate-based mechanisms preferred over refresh tokens.
* Policy for regular rotation of client secrets and certificates.

## 7. Audit, Logging & Compliance

### Central audit logs

Log security-relevant events:
- Logins, token issuance, mTLS handshakes
- Rollout actions, configuration changes, permission changes
- Aggregation in kombifyAdmin for fleet-wide analysis

### Traceability

- Correlation IDs and user/service IDs in all logs (propagated by kombifyAPI).
- Ability to reconstruct a tenant's complete change history for a homelab.

---

## 8. Identity Lifecycle

### Provisioning

- Automated user and role creation during onboarding (invite flows from kombifySphere).
- SaaS user creation triggers automatic PocketBase user provisioning in the linked homelab.

### Changes & reassignment

- Role changes in the SaaS layer can be mirrored to local LLDAP groups (optional sync).
- Team moves update group memberships in both cloud and local layers.

### Offboarding

- Immediate token invalidation at the platform IdP.
- Removal of roles and group memberships in both cloud and LLDAP.
- Optional archival of activity for compliance.

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Platform IdP selection**: Zitadel vs. managed alternative vs. custom. Needs evaluation.
2. **Federation protocol**: How exactly does TinyAuth broker between cloud IdP and local PocketID? Needs spec.
3. **Provisioning direction**: Does the cloud push users into LLDAP, or does the homelab pull? Needs decision.
4. **Billing integration**: How do SaaS roles (MANAGER) tie to billing providers? Out of scope for StackKits.
5. **Environments**: How many separate IdP configurations per dev/stage/prod? Depends on SaaS architecture.
