// Native module profiles declare the StackKits hosting envelope. Core host
// floors come from the existing kit contracts and are reused by application
// profiles as an explicit Kombify support policy, not upstream measurements.
// Application RAM reservations are the sum of the pinned runtime component
// reservations expressed exactly in GiB. A reservation is not a
// host minimum or a recommendation. These absolute host floors aggregate by
// maximum; application data capacity is separately governed by DataBinding.
// Equal high/standard profiles do not imply a measured performance benefit.
