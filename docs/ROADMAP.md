# StackKits Roadmap

> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-11  
> **Status:** Active Development — Architecture v4 Migration  
> **Current Version:** v1.0.0-beta  
> **Architecture:** [ARCHITECTURE_V4.md](./ARCHITECTURE_V4.md)  
> **Evaluation:** [EVALUATION_REPORT_2026-02-07.md](./EVALUATION_REPORT_2026-02-07.md)

---

## Executive Summary

StackKits v4 is a fundamental redesign around **three concepts**:

1. **StackKit** = Architecture pattern (base / modern / ha)
2. **Node-Context** = Runtime environment (local / cloud / pi), auto-detected
3. **Add-Ons** = Composable extensions replacing monolithic variants

Combined with a **Progressive Capability Model** (Levels 0–4), this replaces the old variant-based, node-count-driven design.

This roadmap consolidates all planned work into a single milestone-based plan (M0–M9), covering CUE schema fixes, v4 migration, StackKit completion, cross-repo consistency, and ecosystem integration.

## Current State Assessment (2026-02-11)

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| CUE base schemas | 90% | ~2800 lines, production-quality. Package bugs in `base/platform/` and `base/schema/` |
| base-homelab | 60% | CUE validates, services defined, needs E2E testing + variant→Add-On migration |
| modern-homelab | 0% | Entirely K8s/k3s-based — needs **complete rewrite** for Docker multi-node |
| ha-homelab | 0% | Schema only, 8 explicit TODOs |
| stackkit CLI | 80% | 9 commands functional (Go), needs Add-On/Context commands |
| Add-On system | 0% | **NEW** — replaces monolithic variants |
| Context system | 0% | **NEW** — replaces manual compute tier selection |
| kombify Stack integration | 30% | Unifier pipeline exists, needs v4 alignment |
| API server | 85% | All 13 OpenAPI endpoints implemented. Missing: auth, rate limiting, API tests |
| Documentation | 40% | Many outdated docs referencing old concepts (K8s, variants, old naming) |

---

## Cross-Repo Consistency Audit (K1–K15)

Before implementation, a full audit identified critical inconsistencies across StackKits, kombify Stack, kombify Core, and docs repos.

### Critical Findings

| # | Finding | Repos Affected | Severity |
|---|---------|----------------|----------|
| K1 | **K8s references in docs** — Mintlify pages describe K8s/k3s despite removal | docs | High |
| K2 | **License inconsistency** — different licenses cited in different places | docs, StackKits, Stack | High (✅ fixed) |
| K3 | **Naming inconsistency** — "kombifyStack", "kombify Stack", "kombify Stack" etc. | all | High |
| K4 | **Duplicate concept pages** — 3× StackKits explanations, 2× spec-driven pages | docs | Medium |
| K5 | **ha-homelab description** — docs say K8s, code is Docker Swarm | docs | High |
| K6 | **modern-homelab.mdx** — 591 lines entirely about K8s/k3s/FluxCD/Longhorn | docs | High |
| K7 | **GitHub org references** — kombify, kombifyLabs, Soulcreek, kombihq mixed | docs, Stack | Medium |
| K8 | **URL casing** — /Cloud/ vs /cloud/ mixed | docs | Low |
| K9 | **Outdated service references** — "Authelia", "Portainer" instead of "TinyAuth", "Dokploy" | docs | Medium |
| K10 | **"Terraform" on marketing** — should be "OpenTofu" | StackKits | Medium |
| K11 | **Empty Core README** — kombify Core README has no content | Core | Low |
| K12 | **Beyond-IaC undocumented** — gRPC Agents, AI concepts not in public docs | docs | High |
| K13 | **Add-On system undocumented** — neither concept nor schema described | docs | Medium |
| K14 | **Persona system undocumented** — Wizard decision tree missing | docs | Medium |
| K15 | **Local/Cloud split undocumented** — Backend differentiation not documented | docs | Medium |

## Milestones

### M0: Hygiene & v4 Migration (Weeks 1–3) — IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Clean slate. Remove all v3/old-concept artifacts from code and docs. Establish v4 as the only source of truth.

#### Docs Cleanup (this repo)

- [x] Archive `docs/architecture.md` → superseded by `ARCHITECTURE_V4.md`
- [x] Archive `docs/variants.md` → replaced by Add-On + Context model
- [x] Archive `docs/STATUS_QUO.md` → pre-v4, no longer accurate
- [x] Archive `docs/DEFAULT_SPECS_README.md` → references K8s, old variants
- [x] Archive `docs/EVALUATION_REPORT.md` → corrupt encoding, superseded by 2026-02-07 version
- [x] Archive `docs/CODE_REVIEW_2026-01-27.md` → duplicates root CODE_REVIEW_TECHNICAL_REPORT.md
- [x] Archive `docs/cleanup/` (8 files) → consolidated into Cleanup-Plan.md already
- [x] Update `docs/README.md` → new index reflecting v4 docs
- [ ] Update `docs/creating-stackkits.md` → deferred to M4 (variant dirs still exist in code, TD-12)
- [x] Update `docs/stack-spec-reference.md` → removed K8s sections and examples

- [ ] Update `docs/CLI.md` → deferred to M2 (Add-On/Context commands not yet implemented)

#### Root Files Cleanup

- [x] Delete `{{range` (junk file at root)
- [x] Delete `stackkit.exe` (committed binary — already in .gitignore)
- [x] Add `stackkit.exe` to `.gitignore` explicitly
- [x] Update root `README.md` → remove variant references in "StackKit Specification" section
- [x] Update `DEPLOYMENT.md` → remove "Kubernetes manifests" reference
- [x] Update `DEPLOYMENT_CONTRACT.md` → fix naming inconsistencies
- [x] Update `stack-spec.yaml` → remove `variant: default`, `mode: simple`

#### CUE/Schema Consistency

- [x] File naming: `modern-homelab/stackkit.cue` → `stackfile.cue`
- [x] Remove duplicate schema definitions (`base/layers.cue` vs `base/platform/identity.cue`)
- [x] Fix package declarations in `base/platform/*.cue` (declares `package base` in subdirectory)
- [x] Fix package declarations in `base/schema/*.cue` (same issue)
- [x] Compute tier naming: Go `minimal/standard/performance` → CUE `low/standard/high` (align to CUE)
- [x] Platform type: remove `kubernetes` from Go validator (ADR-0002)
- [x] Fix Layer 3 PAAS validation logic (currently inverted in Go)
- [x] Consolidate `#BaseHomelabStack` vs `#BaseHomelabKit` → single canonical schema

---

### M1: Core IaC Pipeline (Weeks 3–6)

**Goal:** CUE schemas produce real, deployable infrastructure. Base Kit end-to-end.

- [ ] CUE-as-SSoT: CUE validates + exports `tfvars.json` (not template rendering)
- [ ] OpenTofu modularization: split `main.tf` (1130 lines) into modules (traefik, dokploy, monitoring, identity)
- [ ] `bridge.go` rewrite: CUE export → tfvars.json pipeline
- [ ] base-homelab end-to-end: `validate → generate → plan → apply`
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline: `cue vet ./...`, Go tests, lint on every push
- [ ] **API hardening: Fix filesystem write vulnerability in `handleGenerateTFVars`** (TD-27, P0)
- [ ] **API hardening: Add authentication middleware** (TD-28, P0)
- [ ] **API hardening: Fix compute tier enum mismatch in OpenAPI spec** (TD-29, P0)
- [ ] **API hardening: Add rate limiting middleware** (TD-33, P1)
- [ ] **API hardening: Add API handler test coverage** (TD-34, P1)
- [ ] **API hardening: Capture response status in logging middleware** (TD-35, P1)
- [ ] JSON schema export for IDE support (`cue export --schema`)
- [ ] Fix `base.#Layer3Applications.services` constraint (Array vs Map — W8)
- [ ] Port collision detection as CUE constraint
- [ ] Service dependency validation (`needs[]` references enabled services)

**Done Criteria:** `stackkit validate && stackkit generate && stackkit plan` works for base-homelab.

---

### M2: Context System & Backend Split (Weeks 5–8)

**Goal:** Node-Context replaces manual compute tier selection. Local vs Cloud differentiation works.

#### Context System Implementation

- [ ] Define context detection criteria in CUE constraints
- [ ] Create `contexts/local.cue` — full Docker, local TLS, Dokploy
- [ ] Create `contexts/cloud.cue` — Let's Encrypt, Coolify, egress-aware
- [ ] Create `contexts/pi.cue` — ARM images, reduced services, tmpfs
- [ ] Context-driven PAAS selection (Dokploy for local, Coolify for cloud)
- [ ] Context-driven TLS strategy (self-signed vs Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Context-driven resource limits

#### Backend Split

- [ ] `base-homelab-local` vs `base-homelab-cloud` CUE differentiation
- [ ] `#NodeDefinition.type` extension: `"local" | "cloud"` with different SSH defaults
- [ ] Cloud provider abstraction: Hetzner module as first cloud backend
- [ ] VPN bridging schema for hybrid setups (Headscale/WireGuard)

**Done Criteria:** `stackkit apply` works with `--context local` and `--context cloud`. Context auto-detection from hardware.

---

### M3: StackKit Completion (Weeks 9–12)

**Goal:** All three StackKits implemented as architecture patterns per v4.

#### Base Kit Refinement

- [ ] Remove old `variants/` directory (replaced by Add-Ons and Contexts)
- [ ] Consolidate to single schema (`#BaseHomelabKit` only)
- [ ] Update spec format to v2 `kombination.yaml`
- [ ] Context × base matrix tests (local, cloud, pi)

#### Modern Homelab Kit — COMPLETE REWRITE

Current state: entirely K8s/k3s-based. Must be rewritten as **hybrid Docker multi-node**.

- [ ] Delete all K8s/FluxCD/Longhorn schemas and tests
- [ ] Define VPN overlay networking as core requirement
- [ ] Implement Coolify as default PAAS (required for multi-environment)
- [ ] Add split DNS configuration (local vs public)
- [ ] Define service placement rules (which services go where)
- [ ] Implement `modern × local` and `modern × cloud` contexts
- [ ] Create E2E test with 2-node deployment (1 local + 1 cloud)

#### High Availability Kit

- [ ] Implement Docker Swarm orchestration config
- [ ] Add Keepalived VIP for load balancing
- [ ] Define quorum-based consensus rules in CUE
- [ ] Implement LLDAP cluster + Step-CA HA
- [ ] Implement `ha × local` and `ha × cloud` contexts
- [ ] Mark `ha × pi` as not recommended (resource validation)

**Done Criteria:** All StackKit x Context combinations validate (`ha × pi` excluded). Each StackKit has ≥1 deployable configuration.

---

### M4: Add-On System (Weeks 11–14)

**Goal:** Composable Add-Ons replace monolithic variants. First Add-Ons are functional.

#### Add-On Infrastructure

- [ ] Define `#AddOn` CUE schema (metadata, compatibility, constraints, resources, services)
- [ ] Create `addons/` directory structure with `_schema/addon.cue`
- [ ] Implement Add-On dependency resolution in CUE
- [ ] CLI commands: `stackkit addon add/list/remove/search`

#### Migrate Variants → Add-Ons

- [ ] `base-homelab/variants/service/coolify.cue` → `addons/coolify-paas/`
- [ ] `base-homelab/variants/service/beszel.cue` → `addons/monitoring/` (subset)
- [ ] `base-homelab/variants/service/minimal.cue` → `contexts/pi.cue` defaults (fold in)
- [ ] `base-homelab/variants/service/default.cue` → base defaults (fold in)
- [ ] `base-homelab/variants/compute/compute.cue` → Context system
- [ ] `base-homelab/variants/os/*.cue` → OS detection (auto, not user-chosen)
- [ ] Delete `base-homelab/variants/` directory after migration

#### Core Add-Ons

- [ ] `addons/monitoring/` — Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager
- [ ] `addons/backup/` — Restic + configurable targets
- [ ] `addons/vpn-overlay/` — Headscale/Tailscale mesh
- [ ] `addons/gpu-workloads/` — NVIDIA/AMD GPU passthrough (local/cloud only)
- [ ] `addons/media/` — Jellyfin + *arr stack
- [ ] `addons/smart-home/` — Home Assistant + MQTT (local/pi only)

**Done Criteria:** `#AddOn` schema defined. ≥3 Add-Ons migrated from variants. CLI commands functional.

---

### M5: CUE Decision Logic (Weeks 13–15)

**Goal:** All documented-but-unimplemented CUE constraints are enforced.

#### Priority A (Block incorrect deployments)

- [ ] D1: Network mode decision (local → Bridge, public → Traefik+ACME, hybrid → VPN+Split-DNS)
- [ ] D2: PAAS auto-selection (local domain → Dokploy, public → Coolify)
- [ ] D4: Firewall port auto-generation (from `services[*].network.ports`)
- [ ] D9: TLS ACME domain constraint (ACME + .local = error)
- [ ] D14: Container image version policy (no `latest` in production)

#### Priority B (Security & stability)

- [ ] D3: Identity provider cascade (zeroTrust → TinyAuth OR PocketID must be active)
- [ ] D5: Volume backup filter (auto from `volumes[backup==true]`)
- [ ] D7: Resource budget validation (sum services RAM ≤ node RAM)
- [ ] D8: Port collision detection (duplicate host ports)
- [ ] D10: Node count platform constraint (docker-swarm → min 3 nodes)

#### Priority C (Extended logic)

- [ ] D6: Service dependency validation (`needs[]` references enabled service)
- [ ] D11: Variant→Add-On feature matrix (CUE logic, not manual tests)
- [ ] D12: Upgrade path validation (allowed Add-On transitions)
- [ ] D13: mTLS service policy (StepCAMTLSPolicy enforced)

**Done Criteria:** `cue vet ./...` checks all constraints. Invalid configs rejected with clear messages.

---

### M6: Terramate & Day-2 Operations (Weeks 15–17)

**Goal:** Terramate integrated into CLI. Drift detection functional.

- [ ] Terramate integration in CLI: `stackkit drift` command
- [ ] Terramate change detection: `terramate run --changed` workflow
- [ ] Terramate stack tags for layer assignment (`stack.tags = ["layer:1", "identity"]`)
- [ ] Drift detection as scheduled run
- [ ] OpenTofu state backend strategy: S3 for prod, local for dev, per Context
- [ ] OpenTofu provider locking (`.terraform.lock.hcl`)
- [ ] CUE schema versioning

**Done Criteria:** `stackkit drift --check` detects deviations.

---

### M7: kombify Stack Integration (Weeks 17–21)

**Goal:** Unifier pipeline in kombify Stack understands StackKits v4.

- [ ] Update `resolver.go`: StackKit selection by architecture pattern (not node count)
- [ ] Update `addons.go`: load Add-Ons from `addons/` directory
- [ ] Update `analyze.go`: generate Node-Context from agent hardware reports
- [ ] Update `unify.go`: merge StackKit + Context + Add-Ons into unified CUE evaluation
- [ ] Update `stackkit_loader.go`: load `contexts/*.cue` alongside StackKit schemas
- [ ] Align CUE module path across repos
- [ ] Update web wizard for 3-concept flow (pattern → nodes → add-ons → customize → deploy)
- [ ] Agent context auto-detection via `Register` RPC hardware reports

**Done Criteria:** Unifier pipeline processes StackKit + Context + Add-Ons. Web wizard reflects v4.

---

### M8: Beyond-IaC & AI Foundation (Weeks 19–25)

**Goal:** Runtime intelligence layer prototype. AI-assisted operations as SaaS concept.

#### gRPC Agent Integration

- [ ] CUE outputs consumable by gRPC agent
- [ ] `kombination.yaml` structure harmonized with StackKit schemas
- [ ] Agent capabilities as CUE schema (`#NodeCapabilities`)
- [ ] Service placement algorithm (filter → score → place) as CUE constraints

#### Integration Paths v1

- [ ] CUE schema for `#IntegrationPath` (type, direction, auth, events)
- [ ] First implementations: Cloudflare DNS, Slack/Discord webhooks
- [ ] Integration events: `service.deployed`, `health.degraded`, `backup.completed`

#### AI Self-Healing (Prototype)

- [ ] Pipeline: Detect → Diagnose → Heal
- [ ] Escalation model: Low (auto-restart) → Medium (rollback) → High (rebalance) → Critical (notify)
- [ ] Health score calculation (0–100)
- [ ] Anomaly detection baseline

**Done Criteria:** Base-homelab deployment sends status via gRPC agent and creates DNS record at Cloudflare.

---

### M9: Documentation & Public Readiness (Parallel, Weeks 15–25)

**Goal:** Public docs are current, consistent, and complete.

#### Mintlify Docs

- [ ] Beyond-IaC concept page (K12)
- [ ] Add-On system concept page (K13)
- [ ] Persona system concept page (K14)
- [ ] Local/Cloud split documentation (K15)
- [ ] All StackKit pages updated to v4
- [ ] Migration guides (base → ha, base → modern)
- [ ] Visual decision tree (Mermaid): which StackKit for which use case
- [ ] CLI + Add-On documentation

#### Marketing & Website

- [ ] Fix "Terraform" → "OpenTofu" on marketing site (K10)
- [ ] Remove K8s references from marketing
- [ ] Consolidate `marketing/` vs `website-v2/` (decide canonical site)

#### API Documentation

- [ ] Catalog endpoints (`GET /api/v1/stackkits`, `GET /api/v1/stackkits/{name}`)
- [ ] Validation endpoint (`POST /api/v1/validate`)
- [ ] Generation endpoint (`POST /api/v1/generate/tfvars`)

**Done Criteria:** Every Mintlify page shows current content. No dead links. No K8s references.

## Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|:-----------:|:------:|------------|
| CUE export complexity underestimated | Medium | High | Prototype with 1 service first, not all at once |
| modern-homelab rewrite scope | High | Medium | Clear differentiation from ha-homelab in M3 |
| AI features too ambitious | High | Low | M8 explicitly scoped as prototype |
| Cross-repo synchronization drift | Medium | Medium | M0 creates the basis, M9 maintains |
| Single-developer bottleneck | High | High | Small milestones, feedback loops, pipeline automation |
| Old concepts leaking into new code | Medium | High | M0 archival + TECHNICAL_DEBT.md tracking |

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| `cue vet` passes for all StackKits | 100% |
| E2E deployment success (base, local) | > 95% |
| StackKit × Context combinations validated | 8/9 (ha×pi excluded) |

## Database & API Status

**StackKits does NOT use a database.** It's a CUE schema + OpenTofu repo.

The **StackKit catalog/admin UI** stores data in `kombify-DB` under `content_stackkits`, `content_stackkit_tools`, etc.

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| CUE schemas, OpenTofu configs | This repo |
| StackKit catalog data | `kombify-DB` → `content_*` tables |
| Prisma schema for TS admin UI | `kombify-DB/prisma/schema.prisma` |
| SQL migrations | `kombify-DB/migrations/000003_content.up.sql` |

**API server status:**

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| HTTP scaffold (Go, port 8082) | ✅ Done |
| OpenAPI spec at `/api/v1/openapi.yaml` | ✅ Done |
| Catalog endpoints (list, get, schema, defaults, variants) | ✅ Done (5 endpoints) |
| Validation endpoints (full + partial) | ✅ Done (2 endpoints) |
| Generation endpoints (tfvars + preview) | ✅ Done (2 endpoints) |
| Utility endpoints (health, capabilities) | ✅ Done (2 endpoints) |
| Authentication middleware | ⬜ Not started (TD-28) |
| Rate limiting | ⬜ Not started (TD-33) |
| API handler tests | ⬜ Not started (TD-34) |
| Filesystem write fix (outputDir) | ⬜ Not started (TD-27) |

## Architecture Reference

See [ARCHITECTURE_V4.md](./ARCHITECTURE_V4.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

Key concepts:
- **StackKit** = Architecture pattern (base / modern / ha)
- **Node-Context** = Runtime environment (local / cloud / pi), auto-detected
- **Add-Ons** = Composable extensions (replace variants)
- **Progressive Capability Model** = Levels 0–4 (CLI → SaaS)
- **3-Layer Architecture** = L1 Foundation, L2 Platform, L3 Applications (preserved)
