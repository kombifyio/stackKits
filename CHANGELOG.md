# Changelog

All notable changes to kombify-StackKits are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Native `init --candidate-spec <file|->` preserves a complete approved v2
  StackSpec through the existing CUE validation, compare-and-swap persistence
  and local owner custody. It refuses competing authoring overrides instead
  of reconstructing and losing workload, profile or placement decisions.

- Cloud public-edge executor contracts preserve the canonical `ingressAuth`
  route policy through strict decoding and the runtime policy digest. Native
  application authentication no longer blocks Cloud Kit generation; unknown
  modes remain invalid and omitted modes retain the CUE `native` default.

### Added

- Use-case catalog: `#UseCaseSetting` declares what an operator decides per
  use case before install (kind, group, depth, help, options, default,
  realization), and `docs` names the guide on docs.kombify.io. The release
  projection `stackkits-use-case-catalog-v1.json` carries both; consumers
  derive the backend alternative and compute profile from `components` and
  `computeTiers` as before.

- StackKits WebMCP v2alpha1 and `https://stackkit.cc/planner`: four read-only,
  schema-first module-profile/catalog/capacity/handoff tools share one visible
  Planner state and CUE-derived public catalog. The handoff projects
  `init → validate → resolve → generate → plan`; Apply remains an explicit,
  non-executable follow-up. The complete core, component, reference host,
  schemas, generated data, and affected tests are part of the OSS export.
- Architecture v2 Smart Home workload: catalog `home-assistant` on Basement/Cloud/Modern, pinned `home-assistant/home-assistant:2026.7.2`. Self-hosted container only. Generate writes the reverse-proxy `configuration.yaml` baseline (Homelab name, `trusted_proxies`, `external_url` when the delivery host is known), `.stackkit/agent/home-assistant.mcp.json` for native `/api/mcp` on `https://smart-home.<domain>`, and Homelab owner intent (`username: homelab`). Setup creates that owner through `/api/onboarding/users`. Config volume is a StackKits backup source. No HA OS, Supervisor, Zigbee, or MQTT runtime in this slice.
- Use-case agent surface (`#UseCaseAgentSurfaceV1`, ADR-0038). Generate writes workspace `.stackkit/agent-surface.json` for selected workloads. Photos is the reference: Immich REST, family-vault skill, no product MCP. Smart Home emits the Home Assistant `/api/mcp` client fragment plus the `homelab-mcp` skill. Coolify delivery is unchanged.
- Architecture v2 Media workload: catalog `jellyfin` on Basement/Cloud/Modern `standard` and `high`, pinned `jellyfin/jellyfin:10.10.7`. Library volume is owner-custodied and not a StackKits backup source. Basement `low` still omits Media.

### Changed

- Native `stackkit/v2alpha2` uses explicit module-local compute, storage and
  accelerator profiles plus workload alternatives. The earlier kit-global tier
  contracts below are retained only through the explicit `v2alpha1` adapter.
  CPU/RAM/storage sliders preserve undeclared values, and incomplete CUE capacity
  facts cannot produce a ready handoff. Required host facts must be observed in
  inventory before Apply, not inferred from declared hardware intent.
- Remove the obsolete `modules` dispatch input from the catalog Delivery
  adapter; module contract verification owns its catalog selection.

- Affected-test hang guards follow the 5-minute phase cap: one planned `go test` may run 180s, and the wrapper kill is 5 minutes. The previous 90s/2-minute pair aborted legitimate Architecture v2 catalog evaluation and `cmd/stackkit/commands` generate proofs. CUE authority changes compile the embed instead of selecting a Go test name that does not exist.

- Photos no longer lists `ente-photos` as a catalog component, package tool, or kit YAML alternative. `component-closure` follows Immich only. Ente stays post-1.0 until a module exists. The public compatibility projection collapses identical use-case/adapter rows from multiple alternatives and fail-closes when those rows disagree.
- Basement `stackkit generate` after `--use-case photos,files,vault` on `standard` emits `basement-core`, `immich`, `cloudreve`, and `vaultwarden` (not the low-graph lite substitutes).
- Basement `stackkit generate` after `--compute-tier low --use-case photos,files,vault` emits `basement-core-lite` and `immich-lite` (standalone Compose, no Coolify). Media fails closed at init. Authoring docs and Basement YAML `computeTiers.high` floors follow the CUE graph (2C/4GB min, not 4C/8GB). Cloud YAML `low` remains kitio roundtrip with no graph.
- Files and Vault catalog workloads declare `computeTiers` alternatives. The public use-case catalog and MCP `stackkit_use_case_compute_tiers` project package fits and load so the Techstack Unifier can omit Media on `low` and treat always-on active-resident as base load. Unifier no longer maps `context: pi` or ARM to `install.computeTier`.
- Init writes catalog `#WorkloadContractV2.computeTiers` alternatives: Basement `--compute-tier low --use-case photos` authors `immich-lite` on `standalone-compose`. Omitted catalog fits fail closed at init and compile. `stackkit generate` accepts `--local-site`/`--local-node` for inventory attest.
- Every use-case package declares `computeTiers.{low,standard,high}` (functions + load residency/baseline/burst on the kit graph). Runtime-profile `contexts` are removed. Photos `low` is Immich without ML; Vault fits all graphs as idle-resident; Media is omitted on `low` until a lite substitution exists. Draft packages (AI, Dev, Mail, Game, Remote) omit all three graphs with reasons.
- Native v2 `install.computeTier` (`low` | `standard` | `high`, default `standard`) selects a kit-declared module graph. Basement publishes `standard` (Coolify PaaS + Immich ML), `low` (standalone, core-lite without Coolify, Immich without ML, floors 2/2/10), and `high` (`telemetry-collection`). Cloud and Modern publish `standard` and `high`, not `low`. Missing or undeclared graphs fail closed. `--hardware-profile` writes `nodes[0].hardware.profile`; `pi` is a constrained homelab device class, not Raspberry-only. Apply does not choose the graph. Host preflight uses the selected graph's host floors. Multi-node Apply without a bound local node fails closed instead of probing nothing. Memory-cgroup guidance is kernel-generic, not Raspberry-only.
- Compiler admits runtime capacity before side effects. Missing inventory facts block Apply (`inventory-fact-unverified`); attested undersize blocks Apply (`runtime-capacity-unsatisfied`). Generation can still succeed.
- Basement and Cloud core runtimes declare minimum attested CPU/RAM/disk; empty inventory no longer silently admits Product Apply.
- Failed Product Apply (human and `--json`) ends with retry/`status`/`logs` guidance and the Run-ID when a local run exists.
- `base-install.sh` and `cloud-install.sh` resume apply on an existing workspace instead of dying.

### Fixed

- Basement mode verification now reports standard placement, bootstrapped
  install, and local context as awaiting current runtime evidence. The historical
  SK-S1 citation no longer implies current-line support proof; the implemented
  paths remain available with the existing mode-matrix warnings.

- Public release lane: the governed go-common projection now pins v0.4.49
  (sum, origin hash and the three projected files that changed since
  v0.4.40), matching `go.mod` since #865. Every public sync since that bump
  had failed at "source go.mod does not contain the governed go-common pin".


## [0.24.2](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.23.0...v0.24.2) (2026-09-02)

### Fixed

* Keep release archive validation focused on packaged contents, executables and
  contract integrity; remove obsolete backup lifecycle assertions from publication.
* Keep the guided Basement and Cloud standard recipes explicit through the CUE
  compatibility adapter; native CLI examples supply module selections.
* Include the public backup and application-readiness documentation in release
  archives and remove a link to private release operations from public authoring docs.

### Added

* integrate recoverable Homelab lifecycle and application experience ([#829](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/issues/829)) ([3f82fd8](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/commit/3f82fd8a343cf5e7f2444f7c6ef49bdf3e00704b))

## [0.22.0](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.24...v0.22.0) (2026-08-26)


### Added

* **apply:** attest local CPU/RAM/disk inventory before resolve ([8e4dd83](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/commit/8e4dd83cf390e982bc8f5feb19740678c4cab263))

## [0.21.24](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.23...v0.21.24) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed

- Verify a valid managed-service TLS certificate without following or rejecting
  an application's expected HTTPS login redirect.

## [0.21.23](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.22...v0.21.23) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed

- Issue managed Cloud Kit certificates with ACME HTTP-01 so the Cloudflare
  gateway can validate origin TLS while normal service traffic remains HTTPS.

## [0.21.22](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.21...v0.21.22) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed

- Route managed Cloud Kit registrations through their generated TLS entrypoint
  so public kombify.me service addresses reach the runtime instead of the
  unused cleartext listener.

## [0.21.21](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.20...v0.21.21) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed

- Synchronize the prefix-aware Cloud Core renderer identity through the CUE
  source and embedded authority bundles so the address-bound plan resolves and
  generates under the exact published contract.

## [0.21.20](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.19...v0.21.20) (2026-08-25)

### Added

- Add a secret-free address-plan and bind contract for managed public service
  names, and render Cloud Core routes from the validated subdomain prefix.

## [0.21.19](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.18...v0.21.19) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed

- Canonicalize validated public TLS runtime routes by route identity before
  lifecycle execution, so CUE's serialized set order cannot make a valid
  multi-route Cloud policy fail Apply.

## [0.21.18](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.17...v0.21.18) (2026-08-25)

### Fixed

- Let an idempotent Apply reuse ports 80 and 443 only when Docker proves they
  belong to the exact current workspace's Cloud Core Compose definition;
  foreign, stale, and unverified listeners remain blocking.

## [0.21.17](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.16...v0.21.17) (2026-08-24)

### Fixed

- Make the Cloud host-security sshd policy the first drop-in evaluated and
  remove its superseded late-order file during Apply, so provider or cloud-init
  defaults cannot keep root key login enabled after hardening.

## [0.21.16](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.15...v0.21.16) (2026-08-24)

### Added

- Extend the native access manifest to `stackkit.access-manifest/v3` with CUE-owned application grouping, display names, lifecycle and operational impact, exact runtime identity, and secret-free internal addresses for measured runtime services.

### Changed

- Synchronize the governed public-contract projection with the active `kombify-go-common` v0.4.30 pin so exact-source OSS export remains reproducible.

- Restore the documented latest-commit and cumulative-branch affected-test commands as direct deterministic planner tasks.

- Bind Use Case default and alternative tool selections to the package-local tool registry, including exact registry-key/module-slug identity.

- Focus shared CUE authority changes on the embedded-bundle behavior, renderer compilation, and concrete CUE consumers instead of executing the historical architecture package suite.

## [0.21.13](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.12...v0.21.13) (2026-08-22)

### Fixed

* **runtime:** preserve the original shared Apply-request digest when narrowing Owner-approved removal to one exact multi-server placement, so every node-local absence receipt remains correlated to the same verified Apply result.

## [0.21.12](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.11...v0.21.12) (2026-08-22)

### Added

* **runtime:** let Owner-approved workload removal select one exact Site/node/execution-channel placement from a verified multi-node Apply result, preserving node-local absence evidence without widening the sealed runtime authority.

## [0.21.11](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.10...v0.21.11) (2026-08-22)

### Added

* **runtime:** expose deterministic, hash-bound applied workload identities in the verified Apply summary so optional orchestrators can correlate Owner-approved node-local removal without parsing StackKits-owned Plan state.
* **runtime:** expose the existing owner-approved workload-removal request and terminal absence-result validator as the public `pkg/workloadremoval` contract, with only a deprecated internal compatibility adapter, so pinned cross-repo consumers can verify StackKits evidence without a second implementation.
* **runtime:** persist and optionally emit bounded `stackkit.workload-removal-evidence/v1` for exact terminal absence validation across pinned channels without exporting applied artifact content or changing the existing removal `--json` result.
* **secrets:** add an explicit, idempotent `stackkit secrets materialize` path so an existing standalone homelab can establish owner-bound custody after selecting a new workload without re-running or replacing its initial StackSpec.

### Changed

* **development:** make the affected gate independent of ambient `go.work`, build source-bound current-v2 development binaries, and add a documented CLI rebuild loop.
* **development:** keep shared CUE slices bounded to their changed contract tests plus bundle-drift proof, and compile generated `*_gen.go` projections without replaying unrelated package suites.
* **apply:** run telemetry-collection before Cloud host-security so kombify-operated kits connect Sentry and PostHog as first tools. Tenant spec envelopes apply Sentry DSN and PostHog keys to process environment without writing them into stack-spec.yaml.

### Fixed

* **use cases:** apply the governed empty placement defaults when a StackSpec author selects a workload without a `placement` block, so programmatic consumers no longer need CLI-specific boilerplate.

## [0.21.10](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.9...v0.21.10) (2026-08-21)

### Fixed

* **apply:** preserve a non-root key-authenticated execution-channel account before Cloud host-security disables `PermitRootLogin`, so Product Apply can still reach the node after hardening.

## [0.21.9](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.8...v0.21.9) (2026-08-21)

### Fixed

* **apply:** install the packages backing the units Cloud host-security enables and the ruleset it loads, so the owner can reach the posture it declares on a stock Ubuntu host instead of failing on absent `nft` and `fail2ban`.
* **apply:** reload only a running sshd and ensure the sshd privilege separation directory, so Cloud host-security hardening holds on a socket-activated Ubuntu host.

## [0.21.8](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.7...v0.21.8) (2026-08-21)

### Fixed

* **runtime:** retain the bounded command and process output when Cloud host-security reconciliation fails so a live target names the exact failing unit.

## [0.21.7](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.6...v0.21.7) (2026-08-21)

### Fixed

* **cloud:** retain exact runtime-owned public-route health outcomes after validating them against their Cloud core module probes.

## [0.21.6](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.5...v0.21.6) (2026-08-21)

### Fixed

* **cloud:** accept the shared `not-configured` observation for the intentionally healthcheck-less socket proxy during exact Cloud core verification.

## [0.21.5](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.4...v0.21.5) (2026-08-21)

### Fixed

* **apply:** execute all-local Cloud Kit owners through their exact local router after managed-channel admission, and preserve a digest-verified process adapter's basename for its closed operations mode.

## [0.21.4](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.21.1...v0.21.4) (2026-08-21)

### Fixed

* **apply:** accept dispatcher plan-class metadata on Cloud Kit owners and host-admission so Product Apply no longer fails closed with `health:stackkits-host-admission=executor-failed`.

## [0.21.1](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.22...v0.21.1) (2026-08-20)

### Changed

* **kit metadata:** use one CUE and Go metadata schema across Basement, Cloud, and Modern manifests while retaining their intentionally distinct root document kinds; preserve maturity/status through import, API, OpenAPI, and roundtrip hashing.

### Added

* **use cases:** complete all ten first-class CUE package authorities with Vault, Media, draft AI/Dev/Remote, and post-1.0 draft Mail/Game; bind their existing Basement and Cloud Kit roles without inventing a Game default.
* **cloud:** implement the provider-neutral Cloud core runtime, guarded local Product Apply, live Verify observation, and the exact access-manifest v2 projection for base/auth/id/coolify while leaving provider and credential custody in Techstack.

### Fixed

* **cloud:** bind public route-health execution to its Runtime Owner and probe Cloud Hub on its dedicated loopback health listener.
* **access:** reject stale, foreign, or mutated Cloud service projections during Verify and Status readback.
* **release:** treat a missing Release Please PR as expected for derived-version publishes instead of failing after the public GitHub Release already exists.
* **cli:** reject the retired `base-kit` installer argument instead of rewriting it to `basement-kit`.
* **docs:** restore the documented `docs:use-cases:generate` and `docs:use-cases:check` task routes to the existing CUE-derived projection emitter.
* **public export:** include the first-class `use-cases/` CUE authorities in the OSS source distribution.
* **public export:** keep the exported Cloud Kit README independent of the private roadmap tree.
* **release:** keep the Windows exporter and no-tag public sync aligned with the pre-1.0 structural gate after retired test harnesses were removed.
* **docs:** keep the exported historical update-lifecycle notes in English.

### Removed

* **add-ons:** remove every importer-less non-cross-cutting legacy stub: the ten use-case duplicates plus unresolved Authelia and Calendar product definitions. Unimplemented OpenCloud, MQTT/Zigbee, identity, calendar, Mail, Game, AI, Dev, and Remote runtime details remain unclaimed.

## [0.18.22](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.14...v0.18.22) (2026-08-18)

### Changed

* **cue:** rename the shared schema package from `base` to `foundation` (`github.com/kombifyio/stackkits/foundation`). Product kits are unchanged.
* **cue:** remove the `#BaseStackKit` alias. Kits extend `#FoundationStackKit`.
* **cli:** reject the retired `base-kit` slug instead of rewriting it to `basement-kit`.
* **release:** ship `foundation/` in the Docker image, public export, and installer. Archives must contain `foundation/`.

### Fixed

* **release:** keep historical CHANGELOG path mentions as text so the public export no longer links to retired `base/*.cue` files.
* **release:** require `foundation/stackkit.cue` in published archives instead of the retired `base/stackkit.cue` path.

## [0.18.14](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.13...v0.18.14) (2026-08-15)

### Fixed

* **release:** include every static schema and compatibility document required by the public GoReleaser archives

## [0.18.13](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.12...v0.18.13) (2026-08-15)

### Fixed

* **release:** remove deliberately deleted pre-1.0 tests from the public surface policy

## [0.18.12](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.11...v0.18.12) (2026-08-15)

### Fixed

* **release:** remove the retired distribution-fingerprint option from both public export implementations

## [0.18.11](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.9...v0.18.11) (2026-08-15)

### Fixed

* **verify:** preserve the local Architecture v2 runtime report when an orchestrator-provided release bundle has no downloaded workspace receipt cache
* **apply:** allow resolved public-route health executors to run instead of blocking a valid kit rollout
* **installer:** retain the selected Cloud domain and target the public release repository explicitly
* **release:** remove deleted pre-1.0 test files from the curated public export manifest

## [0.18.9](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.8...v0.18.9) (2026-08-15)

### Fixed

* **apply:** expose the bounded leaf cause from failed Product Apply reconciliation so live installer errors reach orchestrator logs

## [0.18.8](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.7...v0.18.8) (2026-08-15)

### Fixed

* **apply:** retain bounded Standard execution-channel stderr so orchestrators expose the actual installer failure instead of only `executor-failed`

## [0.18.7](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.2...v0.18.7) (2026-08-15)

### Changed

* **development:** remove tests from public sync and release execution, delete the release/public/evidence Node test fleet and affected-planner meta-tests, reduce `mise run check` to shipped builds, and prohibit release-blocking test/guard reintroduction during v0.x
* **renderer:** stop duplicating CUE-owned identifier formats, instance cardinality, generated naming, and daemon metadata equality checks in the Go renderer
* **init:** remove the current-executable release self-bootstrap from local Architecture v2 initialization while retaining explicit install, upgrade, and receipt verification boundaries

### Fixed

* **cloud-kit:** execute resolved HTTP route-health probes instead of permanently blocking Apply with an unbound-executor marker
* **release:** include the shared Use Case identity in public Architecture v2 authority bundles, use one fixture source-list authority in generator and runtime, and refresh canonical fixture plans with the changed readiness semantics
* **docs:** remove public links to the intentionally private Use Case development projection

## [0.18.2](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.18.1...v0.18.2) (2026-08-14)

## [0.15.9](https://github.com/kombifyio/stackKits/compare/v0.15.8...v0.15.9) (2026-08-10)

## [0.15.8] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- StackKits now emits an identity-bound, versioned runtime observation for
  services, endpoints, health, probes, freshness, and supporting evidence.
- Structured log listing and retrieval provide redacted, bounded pages with
  digest-bound cursors and explicit truncation metadata.

### Changed

- `apply`, `status`, and `verify` keep machine-readable JSON parseable on
  success, denial, and failure, while MCP results expose structured evidence
  alongside human-readable presentation.

### Fixed

- Process runtimes no longer disappear when apply evidence is unavailable,
  observation freshness uses the authoritative apply timestamp, and run IDs
  remain collision-safe under concurrent execution.

## [0.15.3] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- Architecture v2 catalog projections now expose runtime listeners for
  product-owned application delivery without moving lifecycle authority out of
  StackKits.

### Fixed

- Suffix-free numeric v0.x releases publish as normal GitHub releases and
  advance `releases/latest`.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- An idempotent pre-1.0 publisher retry now treats an already-published public
  release as immutable. It validates the exact source/tag but skips SBOM,
  evidence, attestation, and public-trust mutations, preventing regenerated
  Syft documents from invalidating the sealed release-index digests.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Cloud Kit now resolves a required provider-neutral Cloud core workload for
  `base`, `auth`, `id`, and `coolify`, renders one digest-pinned Compose
  project, and executes it through a closed local runtime owner on an
  externally supplied host.
- Owner-signed Cloud runtime custody stores only service-scoped PocketID,
  TinyAuth, and Coolify material. Provider credentials, server credentials,
  leases, inventory, and provider lifecycle remain outside StackKits.
- Cloud Apply and Verify bind the exact generated artifact, authenticated
  execution channel, nine-service image graph, and five post-apply health
  conditions. The generated access manifest exposes the four Cloud core
  services over the plan-owned public TLS domain.

### Changed

- Cloud Kit's native default generation target is Compose and `cloud-core` is
  a required workload. IONOS, centron, BYO-VPS, and local-host selection remain
  Techstack concerns; StackKits receives only an enrolled host channel.

## [0.14.28] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Cloud Kit gained a provider-neutral core runtime that renders and operates
  its service set on an already enrolled external host.

### Fixed

- Apply reconciliation preserves the original failure, refreshes external
  recovery evidence, and keeps bounded runner custody attached to the exact
  delivery continuation.
- Release orchestration preserves authoritative publish failures, handles
  ambiguous dispatch results, and uses a bounded hosted-runner recovery path.

## [0.14.19] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Apply reconciliation now preserves the primary lifecycle failure instead of
  replacing it with a secondary cleanup or reconciliation error.

## [0.14.18] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Apply refreshes the resolved plan before reconciliation so recovery uses the
  current authoritative state.

## [0.14.17] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- The public contract export now includes the producer side of backup bindings
  used by application delivery.

### Fixed

- Package changes are included in StackKits delivery publication instead of
  being omitted from the affected release slice.

## [0.14.15] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Compose-backed and externally connected product-owner channels can be
  combined without splitting runtime custody.

## [0.14.14] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Cloud Apply fails closed until its required backup binding is present.

## [0.14.13] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Native Basement services are included in the architecture v2 projection
  consumed by Techstack.

## [0.14.12] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- Repository standards checks are scoped to StackKits and fail on open P1
  release blockers.
- Core-standard references now resolve to the current canonical workspace
  source.

## [0.14.9] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Standalone Compose installations can restore backups through the native
  StackKits lifecycle.

## [0.14.8] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Delivery operations use one exact-source synchronization path.

## [0.14.7] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Delivery waits for exact StackKits activation before reporting success.
- Affected feedback stays isolated to the selected source slice.

### Changed

- Fast feedback documentation now describes scope-derived checks instead of a
  repository-wide gate.

## [0.14.4] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- CUE-owned StackAction contracts are generated into the public contract
  bundle.

### Changed

- Runtime actions completed the cutover to the public architecture v2 contract.

### Fixed

- Pre-1.0 delivery uses the maturity-aware source-integrity gate for the exact
  numeric version.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-30

> **Fleet and reusable infrastructure lifecycle** with bounded node mutations
> and a third Application Kit on the shared lifecycle platform.

### Added

- Compiler-owned Fleet membership and `add`, `replace`, `drain`, `recover`,
  and `remove` mutation contracts bind exact current/target ResolvedPlans,
  local Owner approval, durable checkpoints, recovery authority, and immutable
  signed evidence.
- Shared plan-only storage allocation, workload data binding, backup source,
  snapshot, restore, and recovery modules are selected by Application Kits
  without gaining provider, credential, target, or multi-server authority.
- Vault with Vaultwarden 1.35.4 is the third native Application Kit. Its exact
  digest-pinned selected-PaaS bundle, parser, executor, Product factory, and
  remote CLI registration reuse the same seven-stage lifecycle and shared
  infrastructure contracts as Photos/Immich and Files/Cloudreve.

### Changed

- Basement Kit and Cloud Kit Definition contracts advance to 5.1.0 and Modern
  Homelab advances to 1.1.0-alpha as all three explicitly admit the optional
  Vault workload.
- CLI, MCP, and State Console consume the same Fleet lifecycle state and
  evidence projection; lifecycle behavior remains in the local StackKits
  owner and Standard Mode remains account-free.

### Fixed

- Stable v0.12-to-v0.13 upgrades inspect and checkpoint the applied generation
  through the exact installed, attested v0.12 binary. The bridge admits only
  the published v0.12 release index, Basement archive, Definition, compiler,
  renderer, and product-authority tuple; v0.13 target generation remains
  governed by the strict current CUE authority.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-30

> **Reusable Application Kit lifecycle platform** with one CUE-owned,
> ResolvedPlan-bound contract shared by independent application verticals.

### Added

- A generic seven-stage Application lifecycle now owns install, manage,
  backup, upgrade with explicit migration, restore, drift, and remove
  contracts. Every stage declares its exact phases, registered operation,
  approval policy, and required evidence.
- Durable Owner-private lifecycle state records collision-resistant operation
  identities, structured content-addressed evidence, authority snapshots,
  digest chains, retry and resume state, recovery-required failures, and
  verified recovery completion.
- Files with Cloudreve is the second selected-PaaS application vertical. It
  compiles through the same catalog, renderer, runtime executor, lifecycle,
  health, and evidence contracts as Photos with Immich.
- Native status, the `stackkit_status` MCP operation, and the State Console
  now project the same verified ResolvedPlan and durable Application lifecycle
  evidence.

### Changed

- Selected-PaaS rendering and local execution use a provider-neutral shared
  core with thin Immich and Cloudreve adapters; Immich-specific core lifecycle
  types are removed.
- Runtime topology and application selection are read exclusively from the
  verified ResolvedPlan. Raw StackSpec topology is no longer consulted after
  resolution, while Inventory remains limited to external execution-channel
  custody.
- The bounded Advanced change-set operation now joins the same lifecycle
  evidence model with exact candidate/current plans, checkpoint, pinned
  execution, Owner observation, rollback, and recovery state. Standard Mode
  remains account-free and independent of Techstack.

### Fixed

- Stable v0.11-to-v0.12 upgrades now inspect and checkpoint the applied
  generation through the exact installed, attested v0.11 binary. The bridge
  admits only the published v0.11 compiler, renderer, Definition, semantic
  authority, Basement archive, and release-index tuple; normal v0.12 target
  generation and mutation remain governed by the strict v0.12 CUE authority.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-30

> **Family Photo Vault reference vertical** across one CUE-owned lifecycle and
> the common standalone operation surface.

### Added

- The Photos use-case package now declares the complete install, manage,
  backup, upgrade, restore, drift, and remove lifecycle with exact registered
  operation identities, supported standalone surfaces, approval policy, and
  bounded evidence classes.
- `stackkit.remove` is the fourteenth standalone operation. CLI, MCP, coding
  agent, Installer discovery, and State Console all project the same
  destructive, Owner-approved workload-removal contract.
- Native Architecture v2 workload removal recovers the exact sealed request
  from successful Apply custody, selects one applied ResolvedPlan workload,
  binds a five-minute local Owner signature to its plan, runtime owner,
  artifact, Site, node, and execution channel, and persists content-addressed
  request and absence evidence.
- Selected-PaaS removal uses a distinct, bounded protocol over the existing
  authenticated executable-digest-pinned Standard execution channel. It
  accepts neither provider lifecycle nor a fresh placement decision and
  validates exact runtime-owner readback before reporting success.

### Changed

- The Family Photo Vault documentation and agent guidance now describe the
  account-free Standard Mode reference flow. Techstack Advanced dispatch and
  compatibility evidence remain independent optional programs.
- Exact-v0.6 whole-deployment removal remains available only on its historical
  compatibility path. Canonical Architecture v2 rejects legacy `--force` and
  `--purge` authority and requires an exact `--workload`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-30

> **Unified standalone operations** behind one exact CLI/MCP contract, with
> the StackKits State Console remaining a review and approval adapter.

### Added

- A canonical standalone Operations registry now owns Init, Validate, Resolve,
  Generate, Plan, Apply, Verify, Status, Logs, Backup, Restore, Upgrade, and
  Drift identities, command paths, mutation metadata, and approval policy.
  The public CLI and native MCP connector bind the same registry; Backup,
  Restore, Upgrade, Drift, native Status/Logs, Validate, and Verify now have
  full MCP parity through the exact same-build sibling CLI.
- The native MCP connector is read-only by default. Every mutating operation
  now requires explicit write opt-in, the exact registered operation identity,
  and explicit local Owner approval before the CLI can be invoked. The State
  Console renders these registered contracts, requests governed approval, and
  never invokes Apply directly.

- Architecture v2 Foundation host hardening now supports Alpine/OpenRC with a
  canonical daily stable-repository upgrade job, active `crond`, and the same
  governed sysctl evidence used by apt hosts.

- `stackkit host attach-conformance` atomically attaches an exact
  `ExternalHostBinding` and matching `HostConformanceReceipt` to one Inventory
  node before canonical plan generation. Workspace escapes, malformed JSON,
  unknown nodes, and post-generation attachment fail closed.

### Fixed

- Alpine VM installation now includes `curl`, which is the exact binary used
  by the governed Host-routed HTTP service verification phase.

- Regenerated the Architecture v2 product and contract-fixture authorities,
  distribution pin, and canonical plans for the Alpine-capable Foundation
  security-baseline contract hash.

- Alpine VM evidence now derives the closed `kvm` virtualization class from
  QEMU/KVM DMI vendor data when `systemd-detect-virt` is unavailable.

- Proxmox OS-matrix clones now disable implicit cloud-init package upgrades so
  the graded install phase runs against the booted kernel and its matching
  modules, including Alpine nftables support.

- Alpine host installation now waits for the OpenRC-managed Docker daemon with
  a bounded 30-second readiness loop before grading Docker and Compose v2.

- Alpine 3.24 Proxmox provisioning now matches cloud-init's exact JSON-encoded
  `scripts_user`/`runcmd` error instead of looking for a non-existent standalone
  JSON field.

- Native Architecture v2 Apply now resumes one exact journaled
  `ProductApplyReconcileRequiredError` through the service-owned recovery
  authority. Only the typed non-empty request digest from the original Apply is
  accepted; unrelated failures remain fail-closed and no provider authority is
  introduced. Persistent reconciliation failures now expose only deterministic
  verified executor/runtime/health contract references and closed
  `FailureCode` pairs; opaque step hashes, adapter output, socket paths, and
  provider data remain private.

- The protected OS matrix now creates native v2 intent with
  `init --owner-source=local` and proceeds directly to generation. It no
  longer invokes current binaries with rejected v0.6 flags or restores the
  removed StackKits host-preparation authority; the exact local StackKit Server
  image is built inside the bounded Generate phase. The protected lab harness
  installs and verifies Docker prerequisites explicitly through apt on
  Ubuntu/Debian or apk/OpenRC on Alpine before installing Candidate bytes.
  Generation also uses the native transactional `stackkit generate` contract
  without the retired `--context` and `--force` switches.
  Exact matrix Candidate binaries now embed the explicit v0.10 `-devel`
  SemVer, source SHA, and commit timestamp through the same version fields as
  release builds; evidence no longer claims a stale nearest Git tag, and
  unreleased candidates remain on the narrowly recognized development path.
  Ubuntu/Debian host prerequisites now install and verify the separately
  packaged Compose v2 plugin before any Candidate lifecycle phase; Alpine
  verifies its existing `docker-cli-compose` plugin through the same command.
  Candidate attestation now validates the same nine-phase native v2 chain as
  the OS-matrix bundle and no longer requires the removed StackKits-owned
  `prepare` phase.
  Debian 12/13 host compatibility now installs Engine and Compose v2 from
  Docker's official signed apt repository because Bookworm does not publish
  Ubuntu's `docker-compose-v2` package name.
  Alpine Proxmox targets now accept only the exact known OpenRC cloud-init
  warning caused by Proxmox's generated `systemctl enable --now
  qemu-guest-agent` command, and still require the boot-finished marker,
  running Guest Agent/SSHD services, and an ED25519 host key.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Every product kit now materializes absolute host storage roots. `#StackSpecV2`
  defaulted `storage` to an empty object, and that empty default won over
  unifying with `#StorageIntentV2`, so a kit authoring `storage: {}` shipped a
  spec with no roots at all. `cloud-kit` and `modern-homelab` both did, and
  `stackkit validate` therefore rejected the CLI's own `stackkit init` output
  with `resolvedPlan.storage.hostRoots.dataRoot: requires an absolute host
  storage root`. Only `basement-kit`, which spells the roots out by hand, was
  unaffected.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-28

> **Modern Homelab and optional orchestration** over the stable, standalone
> v0.8 StackKits lifecycle.

### Added

- Modern Homelab resolves an explicit Home-and-Cloud topology with local Owner
  authority, Owner-specific federation projections, and governed warm-standby
  placement without restoring HA as a separate Kit.
- Signed execution-channel bundles and the digest-pinned process executor
  provide an offline-verifiable boundary for Techstack Advanced Day-2 and RIL
  operations. Inventory carries neither credentials nor transport endpoints.
- Advanced Terramate change sets can be applied through the published CLI with
  mandatory capability, Owner, checkpoint, rollback, and verification
  authority.
- The public release workflow records an exact Modern terminal receipt from
  the bounded live phase before stable publication.

### Changed

- v0.8.0 remains the stable standalone Basement baseline. Standard local
  install, Apply, verify, upgrade, backup, restore, and drift operations remain
  account-free and do not require Techstack or Kombify Cloud.
- Techstack remains an optional orchestrator UI, configuration unifier, and
  RIL dispatcher over pinned public StackKits artifacts and structured
  results; it does not become local lifecycle or Owner authority.

### Fixed

- Advanced drift-reconcile denials now expose their stable machine-readable
  reason code before rendering or lifecycle side effects.
- Execution-channel verification canonicalizes and re-seals runtime requests
  before comparing their governed digests.

### Release evidence

- Stable publication requires the exact source, public export, immutable
  archives, release notes, and Modern terminal receipt to agree before the
  public release is finalized.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-27

> **Stable standalone OSS lifecycle** for an account-free, single-node
> Basement homelab managed end to end through the public `stackkit` CLI.

### Added

- Local CUE, the canonical ResolvedPlan, Owner custody, and lifecycle evidence
  are the authoritative Stack state. `stackkit init --owner-source=local`
  establishes the local Owner identity and its PocketID, TinyAuth, and step-ca
  binding without requiring Kombify Cloud or Techstack.
- Attested GitHub release indexes provide the public distribution authority for
  install, offline verification, and explicit stable, beta, edge, or exact
  SemVer resolution.
- The default Basement workflow renders and operates the host and Docker
  baseline, local ingress, PocketID, TinyAuth, step-ca, Coolify, Hub, and their
  verification endpoints through `init`, `validate`, `generate`, `apply`, and
  `verify`.
- Standard upgrade, backup, staged restore activation, explicit crash recovery,
  and read-only drift detection use the local Owner authority and signed
  lifecycle evidence. `stackkit drift reconcile --mode standard
  --owner-approve` creates mandatory Kopia and executor-state rollback
  checkpoints before generate, Apply, and Verify.
- Offline Advanced capabilities, Owner-pinned trust bundles, deterministic
  Terramate generation, and signed change-set creation establish the optional
  integration boundary for a Techstack orchestration UI without adding Cloud
  authority to the standalone lifecycle.

### Changed

- Techstack is an optional consumer of pinned public StackKits artifacts,
  structured command results, and lifecycle events. Kombify Cloud may provide
  convenience identity sync, but neither service is required for local
  ownership or standard Day-1 and Day-2 operations.
- The public CLI and release surface are structurally separated from private
  publisher, Admin API, database, internal-host, and service-secret paths.

### Fixed

- Kopia repository passwords now enter the fixed local backup executor only
  through sensitive stdin and a child-process environment, avoiding the
  terminal-only prompt that blocked the exact published-archive restore proof.

### Release evidence

- Stable publication requires the exact published `v0.8.0-beta.5` archive to
  install, Apply, Verify, upgrade to the exact candidate, detect drift, and
  preserve the independently proven activation rollback anchor. Archive,
  release index, SPDX SBOM, and GitHub-OIDC attestations remain fail-closed.
- Missing Advanced capability is exercised as a structured denial before
  rendering or lifecycle side effects.

### Known limitations

- v0.8.0 supports the governed single-node Basement path. Multi-node rolling
  upgrades, Photos, Vault, Files, and the broader Modern Homelab profile remain
  v0.9 scope.
- Terramate change-set Apply, Advanced reconcile, coordinated Advanced
  rollback, and restore drills remain unavailable. Standard Apply, upgrade,
  backup, restore, drift detection, and Owner-approved standard reconcile are
  account-free.
- Provider credentials, server provisioning, and host lifecycle remain outside
  StackKits and may be orchestrated by Techstack.

## [0.8.0-beta.6] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Public release-index asset URLs now retain GitHub's repository casing, and
  standalone resolution treats GitHub owner and repository casing
  equivalently.
- Stable Day-2 proof mirrors the attested trusted-root URL in its offline
  release fixture and exercises the candidate CLI's fail-closed Advanced
  change-set denial using the canonical StackSpec.

## [0.8.0-beta.5] - 2026-07-27

> **Offline Advanced-Mode and restore-evidence beta** for deterministic
> Terramate change sets, Owner-controlled local trust, and the exact-archive
> activation/crash-recovery proof required before stable v0.8.

### Added

- `stackkit.advanced-capability/v1` is verified fully offline against injected
  Ed25519 trust, with strict canonical JSON, stack/Owner/operation scope,
  validity, maximum 30-day lifetime, and stable fail-closed denial codes.
- `stackkit advanced trust import` pins and validates a public-key-only trust
  bundle before storing an Owner-signed private record; `trust inspect`
  re-verifies custody and exposes only non-secret issuer/key metadata.
- `terramate` is a native CUE generation target. Basement renders deterministic
  Terramate stacks over the existing OpenTofu modules without adding provider,
  credential, account, or Cloud authority.
- `stackkit advanced change-set create` verifies local Owner custody, trust,
  capability, baseline, candidate, and output scope before temporary files or
  rendering. It persists an Owner-signed, content-addressed change set without
  invoking Terramate, OpenTofu, Docker, Techstack, or a network service.
- The public release workflow has a separate exact-live-release restore proof.
  It verifies the published archive, release index, SBOM, and attestations,
  forcibly interrupts an Owner-approved activation, rejects concurrent
  mutation, proves conservative explicit rollback, then completes a second
  activation plus Owner/service verification.

### Fixed

- Restore validation and volume-copy helpers now override the pinned Kopia
  image entrypoint explicitly, so the required restricted shell command is
  executed consistently by the live activation runtime.

### Known limitations

- The restore proof is implemented in the release workflow but remains
  unverified until it passes against the published `v0.8.0-beta.5` archive.
- Terramate change-set apply, Advanced reconcile, coordinated rollback, and
  restore drills remain unavailable; the implemented Advanced surface stops at
  offline verification, local trust, deterministic rendering, and signed
  change-set creation.

## [0.8.0-beta.4] - 2026-07-27

> **Live restore beta** for owner-approved activation of staged Kopia data,
> durable crash recovery, and a release path whose only long gate is the exact
> published-archive runtime test.

### Added

- Local lifecycle mutations now share one owner-signed, hash-chained journal
  and exclusive workspace authority across config persistence, generation,
  Apply, and upgrade. Upgrade child processes join only their exact
  executable-bound phase through a one-use nonce; ordinary commands never
  implicitly resume an interrupted operation.
- `stackkit upgrade --recover <operation-id>` performs explicit recovery of
  an interrupted standard upgrade. Ambiguous already-claimed child phases fail
  closed, and rollback removes any operation-scoped success proof before
  restoring the prior runtime.
- `stackkit backup restore activate <restore-result-id>` promotes one verified,
  owner-signed staged restore into the exact Basement volumes derived from the
  current CUE ResolvedPlan and generation manifest. It creates a mandatory
  safety snapshot before stopping the verified Compose project.
- `stackkit backup restore recover <operation-id> --rollback` explicitly
  restores every possibly changed live volume from deterministic rollback
  volumes, starts the exact verified Compose artifact, and verifies services
  plus the PocketID Owner binding before closing the signed journal.

### Changed

- Release attestation verification now checks up to six subjects concurrently
  (`--jobs 1..8`) while retaining six retries per subject and failing the whole
  command on any rejection.
- The public trust/runtime workflow is dispatched only after the publisher has
  finalized and verified the immutable draft evidence, removing the tag-push
  race and its fixed polling window without weakening draft, digest,
  attestation, or runtime gates.
- POSIX private lifecycle custody now accepts only `0700` directories or
  `0600` regular files and continues to reject links and irregular paths.
- Pull requests now run only the affected compile/contract gate and
  changed-content secret scan. Container image publication is asynchronous;
  release trust remains bound to archive, SBOM, index, attestation, and the
  published-archive runtime proof.
- Native backup configure, snapshot, and staging restore operations now share
  the same exclusive local lifecycle mutation authority as generate, Apply,
  drift reconcile, upgrade, and restore activation.

### Known limitations

- Stable `v0.8.0` still requires the exact `v0.8.0-beta.4` public archive to
  prove interrupted activation rollback and successful activation on a fresh
  Ubuntu Basement installation.
- Terramate change sets and offline verification of Techstack-issued Advanced
  capabilities remain the final Advanced-Mode implementation slice.

## [0.8.0-beta.3] - 2026-07-27

> **Transactional upgrade beta** for exact target Apply/Verify and honest
> executable runtime rollback. Live data activation and crash recovery remain
> explicit stable blockers.

### Added

- Non-dry-run `stackkit upgrade` now performs the verified target inspection,
  requires an already configured and crash-consistent local Kopia repository,
  creates a Kopia snapshot with an owner-signed anchor and a content-addressed
  executor-state recovery checkpoint, and only then installs the verified
  target release. Every invocation persists a fresh attempt identity and never
  silently resumes a target-only prior snapshot; recovery uses the release
  receipt bound to the verified Apply result, not the inspecting CLI version.
  The snapshot source exposes only the exact Compose-derived StackKits-managed
  volume allowlist and never the whole Docker volume root.
  Missing or malformed checkpoint identifiers fail before installation.
- The standard upgrade transaction now executes the canonical binary extracted
  from the reverified installed target, requires its real generated Plan and
  manifest to equal the prior shadow inspection, applies, and strictly binds
  live verification to the target release receipt, Owner, Apply evidence, and
  runtime before writing an exclusive success marker. Before target mutation it
  verifies an isolated Kopia restore staging result. Target failure restores
  the captured StackSpec and optional Inventory, executes the exact captured
  prior binary through generate/apply/verify, and reports
  `runtime-restored,dataStaged` without claiming that staged data became live.
  `stackkit.upgrade-transaction/v1` results and
  `stackkit.upgrade-event/v1` JSONL events contain only secret-free authority
  references.

### Known limitations

- Automatic rollback restores and verifies configuration and runtime, but the
  verified Kopia restore remains isolated in staging. Managed-volume cutover,
  application boot from restored data, crash-resume, and exact released-archive
  upgrade/rollback evidence remain required before stable v0.8
  upgrade/rollback support can be claimed.
- A second exact current-authority check immediately before target generation
  narrows the concurrent-writer window but does not close it. Upgrade and
  independent Apply/config mutation still need one shared lifecycle lock and
  crash-resume protocol before stable v0.8 can claim concurrent-writer safety.

## [0.8.0-beta.2] - 2026-07-27

> **Standalone boundary correction beta** for the native v2 CLI, local Owner
> custody, public bootstraps, and fast release feedback.

### Changed

- `stackkit generate` is now exclusively the native ResolvedPlan renderer in
  current source. StackSpec v1 fails with explicit migration guidance before
  lifecycle state or output writes, including exact-v0.6 compatibility builds.
- Basement and Cloud public installers now perform only release installation,
  local-Owner `init`, and read-only `validate`. Host preparation, generation,
  plan review, and Apply remain explicit operator steps.
- Cloud Kit now publishes its own CUE-owned local Owner binding. CLI, MCP, and
  agent install plans request local PocketID/step-ca Owner custody without
  creating Basement-specific runtime secrets for Cloud.
- Native MCP exposes individual exact-sibling-bound v2 lifecycle actions; the
  compatibility prepare/update/combined-rollout process actions are retired.
- Fast-Affected compiles production-tagged live-test sources without executing
  target-dependent suites. Exact release-archive installation and runtime E2E
  remains the blocking product test.
- Pre-trust archive validation is limited to structure, executability, and
  public CLI contracts. Native lifecycle execution runs once after the release
  index and attestations exist, against the exact published Basement archive,
  avoiding an impossible dependency on an unpublished release.
- Runtime evidence now derives the GoReleaser archive filename from the
  receipt SemVer without the tag-only `v` prefix.
- Intentional republish deletes a guarded stale draft before moving the public
  tag, and the public trust workflow accepts draft evidence only for its exact
  tag commit recorded by the canonical `release.commit` field.

### Removed

- The unreachable monolithic v1 Go renderer, legacy generator coverage
  inventory, dead static-secret writers, obsolete generator goldens/matrices,
  the MCP rollout macro, and five v0.4 public-installer evidence tests.

### Security

- Native and public Cloud bootstraps cannot silently omit local Owner custody.
- Public bootstrap scripts no longer mutate host prerequisites or silently
  Apply workloads.
- The public CLI dependency/binary boundary and structural OSS export remain
  fail-closed against private clients, internal hosts, and forbidden
  environment names.

### Known limitations

- Stable `v0.8.0` remains blocked on transactional upgrade/rollback, live
  restore cutover, standard drift reconciliation, and capability-gated
  Terramate Advanced evidence.
- Modern Homelab/HA and opt-in Photos, Vault, and Files remain v0.9 scope.

## [0.8.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-26

> **First standalone OSS lifecycle beta** for a provider-free, single-node
> Basement homelab managed by the public `stackkit` CLI.

### Added

- The canonical free workflow:
  `stackkit init --owner-source=local -> validate -> generate -> apply -> verify`.
- Local Ed25519 Owner custody, local step-ca trust material, and a signed Owner
  binding that links the stable `ownerRef` to the PocketID subject and
  certificate without exporting private keys.
- Deterministic native-v2 Basement generation and local Compose Apply/Verify
  for the host and Docker baseline, ingress, PocketID, TinyAuth, step-ca,
  Coolify, Hub, health, and verification endpoints.
- Account-free GitHub Release resolution for explicit SemVer and the `stable`,
  `beta`, and `edge` channels, with atomic installation under
  `.stackkit/releases/`.
- A deterministic `stackkits-release-index/v1`, exact SPDX SBOMs, GitHub-OIDC
  archive attestations, and a separately attested release index. The CLI
  verifies the index before parsing it and caches the index, bundle, trusted
  root, archive, SBOM, and receipt for offline re-verification.

### Changed

- Local CUE intent, the canonical ResolvedPlan, local Owner custody, and local
  lifecycle evidence are authoritative. GitHub Releases are the public
  distribution authority.
- Techstack is an optional Orchestrator UI, RIL/Advanced Day-2 dispatcher, and
  configuration unifier. It consumes pinned public StackKits binaries and
  versioned JSON/JSONL contracts; it is not required for standard lifecycle
  operations.
- Kombify Cloud is an optional convenience lane for account-backed user/group
  projection into PocketID/TinyAuth. Cloud sync cannot replace or mutate the
  locally asserted Owner authority, and StackKits stores no Cloud credential.
- Publisher/Admin operations are excluded from the public `stackkit` binary
  and public export.

### Security

- Release archives, SBOMs, the release index, trusted-root material, Owner
  evidence, and PocketID/step-ca bindings fail closed on digest, identity,
  subject, predicate, or signature substitution before installation or Apply.
- The public release workflow keeps every release as a draft until it has
  attested the exact archive set and retained a bounded standalone Basement
  runtime receipt. Recorded runtime traffic permits only GitHub (or the
  hermetic GitHub fixture) and local services; Kombify-controlled hosts are
  forbidden.

### Known limitations

- `v0.8.0-beta.1` is the mandatory single-node Basement path. Photos, Vault,
  Files, Modern Homelab/HA, and multi-node rolling upgrades remain targeted at
  v0.9 or later.
- The stable `v0.8.0` release remains blocked until the standard Day-2
  upgrade/snapshot/rollback/drift lifecycle and capability-gated Terramate
  Advanced Mode are complete.
- Provider creation, credentials, and server lifecycle remain outside
  StackKits and belong to Techstack or another external host owner.

## [0.7.16] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Modern outbound-control Runtime patch**, shipped with Basement
> Kit, Cloud Kit, and Modern Homelab as the three public release families.

### Added

- A provider-free, node-local Modern outbound-control-agent Runtime that binds
  the exact CUE action contract, performs bind/reconcile/verify, and records
  fresh, digest-bound evidence for every selected Home and Cloud node.

### Changed

- `stackkits-federation-control-agent-runtime` is now v1.1.0, executable and
  `apply-ready` for its exact generated Runtime and Health target.
- Modern Homelab remains included as its own Preview family in every public
  archive set; this change does not introduce a fourth HA Kit.

### Security

- Sealed requests, immutable artifacts, Site/node/channel bindings, action
  TTLs, signatures, nonces, resolved-plan hashes, idempotency and approval
  requirements are revalidated before Operations run.
- Readback rejects inbound Cloud-to-Home authority, general LAN reachability,
  stale or substituted observations, and loss of local autonomy or
  fail-closed cross-Site session behavior. Transport, endpoints, credentials,
  providers, leases and discovery remain external custody.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview: backup, observability, policy and partition
  Runtime owners are separate outstanding slices.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.15] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Cloud offsite-backup Runtime patch**, shipped with Basement
> Kit, Cloud Kit, and Modern Homelab as the three public release families.

### Added

- A provider-free, node-local Cloud offsite-backup Runtime that binds an exact
  opaque backup target and custody attestation, removes obsolete bindings,
  verifies a fresh backup plus restore/readback, and durably commits evidence.
- Shared request contracts that recompute requirement, binding, and projection
  hashes and recheck the maximum-24-hour binding at the actual invocation
  instant.

### Changed

- `stackkits-cloud-offsite-backup-runtime` is now v1.1.0, executable, and
  `apply-ready` for its exact generated Runtime and Health target.
- Current v2 node-local Cloud renderer contracts use exact registered versions,
  placements, and compiler input projections.
- Basement Kit, Cloud Kit, and Modern Homelab remain included as dedicated
  Linux amd64/arm64, macOS amd64/arm64, and Windows amd64 archives plus the
  full StackKits bundle. Modern Homelab remains explicitly Preview.

### Security

- Missing, expired, widened, substituted, partial, stale, future,
  non-monotonic, state-digest-mismatched, or custody-digest-mismatched
  authority and evidence fails closed.
- Provider selection, accounts, regions, buckets, endpoints, credentials,
  leases, resource IDs, target lifecycle, and transport remain outside
  StackKits authority.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview until its remaining control, policy,
  partition, backup, observability, and live-evidence owners graduate.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.14] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Cloud Public-Edge Runtime patch** for both Cloud Kit and the
> Cloud Site of Modern Homelab.

### Added

- A provider-free node-local Public-Edge Runtime that applies the exact
  compiler-owned route set, removes obsolete routes, verifies the complete
  backend and Health-gate closure, and durably commits digest-bound evidence.
- Fresh monotonic Apply, reconcile, verify, and evidence-custody observations
  bound to the sealed request, immutable artifact, Site, node, execution
  channel, and provider/module/Health authority.

### Changed

- `stackkits-cloud-public-edge-runtime` is now v1.1.0, executable, and
  `apply-ready` for the exact generated Runtime and Health targets.
- Cloud Kit and Modern Homelab no longer retain the Public-Edge module or
  Runtime-owner blockers; their independent remaining blockers are unchanged.
- Public Edge remains confined to the child chain delegated by Cloud host
  security's default-deny parent firewall.
- Basement Kit, Cloud Kit, and Modern Homelab remain included as dedicated
  Linux amd64/arm64, macOS amd64/arm64, and Windows amd64 archives plus the
  full StackKits bundle.

### Security

- Partial, stale, future, non-monotonic, unauthorized, target-substituted,
  state-digest-mismatched, and custody-digest-mismatched evidence fails closed.
- DNS mutation, certificate issuance, credentials, endpoints, provider
  resources, leases, and server lifecycle remain outside StackKits authority.

### Known limitations

- Cloud Kit remains Apply-blocked by its independent offsite-backup Runtime.
- Modern Homelab remains Preview until its remaining control, policy,
  partition, backup, observability, and live-evidence owners graduate.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.13] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Cloud host-security Runtime patch** for both Cloud Kit and the
> Cloud Site of Modern Homelab.

### Added

- A provider-free node-local Runtime that applies and reconciles the Cloud host
  firewall, applies the internet-host hardening baseline, verifies exact fresh
  readback, and durably commits digest-bound evidence.
- A closed CUE-owned firewall and hardening policy shared by Cloud Kit and the
  Cloud node of Modern Homelab.

### Changed

- `stackkits-cloud-host-security-runtime` is now v1.1.0, executable, and
  `apply-ready` for the exact generated Site/node Runtime and Health targets.
- Host firewall ownership is separated from Public Edge: the default-deny
  parent ruleset delegates only the declared public-service child chain.
- Modern Homelab remains included as dedicated Linux amd64/arm64, macOS
  amd64/arm64, and Windows amd64 archives plus the full StackKits bundle.

### Security

- Missing, stale, future, substituted, or digest-mismatched operation and
  evidence observations fail closed.
- Provider resources, leases, credentials, endpoints, transport, and server
  lifecycle remain outside StackKits authority.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview until its remaining control, policy,
  partition, backup, observability, and live-evidence owners graduate.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.12] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Modern Homelab installer patch** that makes the third public
> StackKit installable through the same public release path as Basement and
> Cloud.

### Fixed

- `install.sh modern-homelab` now selects the dedicated
  `stackkits-modern-homelab` archive instead of rejecting the Kit.
- The default public-catalog and explicit `all` install paths now stage
  `modern-homelab` alongside `basement-kit` and `cloud-kit` under
  `~/.stackkits`.
- The generated `install.stackkit.cc` script and installer regression contract
  carry the same three-Kit selection.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview until its remaining control, policy,
  partition, backup, observability, and live-evidence owners graduate.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.11] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Modern Homelab backend-Health patch** that verifies the exact
> Cloud-edge-to-Home workload path while retaining all three StackKit release
> families.

### Added

- Compiler-derived, address- and credential-free HTTP/TCP Health probes for
  executable Modern bridge publications.
- Exact fresh backend readback for every declared `{nodeRef, instanceRef}`
  Home origin.

### Changed

- `stackkits-bridge-publication-runtime` is now v1.2.0 and owns the
  publication's edge-to-origin Health verification.
- The canonical Immich publication no longer carries
  `health-gate-not-executable`.
- Modern Homelab continues to ship as dedicated Linux amd64/arm64, macOS
  amd64/arm64, and Windows amd64 archives plus the full StackKits bundle.

### Security

- Missing, additional, foreign, stale, unhealthy, or target-substituted
  backend evidence fails closed.
- Apply and obsolete-removal observations cannot satisfy the Health gate.
- Endpoints, DNS, certificates, credentials, transport implementation,
  provider lifecycle, leases, discovery, and general LAN access remain outside
  StackKits.

### Known limitations

- HTTPS backend Health remains contract-only until an executor-private binding
  supplies SNI, peer identity, and trust roots.
- Modern Homelab remains Preview until its remaining control, policy,
  partition, backup, observability, and live-evidence owners graduate.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.10] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Modern Homelab federation-link runtime patch** that makes the
> provider-free Home/Cloud link boundary executable while retaining all three
> StackKit release families.

### Added

- One authenticated Product Runtime owner for each exact compiler-selected
  Modern Home and Cloud node.
- Closed establish, obsolete-removal, and verify operations with fresh
  node-local Runtime and Health evidence.
- Strict validation of the compiler-owned link requirement and the external
  fabric receipt, including opaque custody references and a maximum 24-hour
  validity window.

### Changed

- `stackkits-federation-link-runtime` is now v1.1.0, `apply-ready`, and emits
  one immutable artifact per selected Home or Cloud node.
- Runtime-only bridge gaps no longer block deterministic generation. Modern
  generation is ready; Apply remains fail-closed on the missing external
  binding and the independent control-agent, policy, partition, backend-Health,
  backup, observability, and other unbound owners.
- The obsolete overlay and device-verifier readiness blockers are retired
  only where their exact Product owners are already executable and bound.
- Modern Homelab continues to ship as dedicated Linux amd64/arm64, macOS
  amd64/arm64, and Windows amd64 archives plus the full StackKits bundle.

### Security

- The executor revalidates the sealed request, immutable artifact, Site, node,
  execution channel, requirement/binding hashes, and
  `issuedAt <= now < validUntil` immediately before mutation.
- Readback must prove authenticated peers, declared flows only, default deny,
  local autonomy, no default route, no broad or private-subnet advertisement,
  no general LAN reachability, and no inbound Cloud-to-Home authority.
- Fabric implementation, endpoints, credentials, provider resources, leases,
  server-provider lifecycle, and discovery remain outside StackKits.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview until its remaining control-agent,
  backend-Health, policy/partition, backup, observability, and live-evidence
  owners graduate.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.9] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Modern Homelab publication-runtime patch** that turns the
> exact Cloud-side publication handoff into an authenticated node-local owner
> while retaining all three StackKit release families.

### Added

- One provider-free Product Runtime registration for each exact
  compiler-selected Modern Cloud edge node.
- Closed apply, obsolete-removal, and verify operations for the generated
  publication set, with fresh postcondition evidence.
- Exact readback for the public host/path/methods, access and rate-limit
  policy, TLS posture, origin identity, backend module/unit/node/instance,
  data binding, and independent Health-gate reference.

### Changed

- `stackkits-bridge-publication-runtime` is now v1.1.0, `apply-ready`, and
  materialized as one immutable artifact per Cloud edge node.
- The former Cloud-side publication `runtime-owner-unbound` blocker is
  retired. Executable backend service Health remains an independent gate.
- Modern Homelab continues to ship as dedicated Linux amd64/arm64, macOS
  amd64/arm64, and Windows amd64 archives plus the full StackKits bundle.

### Security

- The executor validates the sealed request and immutable artifact, then binds
  request/artifact digests, Site, node, execution channel, and one trusted UTC
  evaluation time before any operation runs.
- DNS mutation, certificate issuance, credentials, endpoints, provider
  lifecycle, leases, transport implementation, server-provider authority, and
  general LAN access remain outside StackKits.
- Node, Site, publication, origin-target pair, access, TLS, identity, and
  readback substitution fail closed.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview until its remaining Cloud-verifier,
  backend-Health, partition-enforcement, and live-evidence owners graduate.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.8] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Modern Homelab federation-boundary patch** that partitions
> every generated federation handoff by runtime owner while keeping Modern in
> the public three-Kit release.

### Changed

- Modern federation Policy, Link, Control, Backup, and Observability now
  receive five distinct compiler-owned projections instead of shared
  `bridge`, `identity`, `data`, and `failurePolicy` graphs.
- Link authority is outbound-only, Control is allowlisted and
  replay-protected, Backup is limited to governed data placement and
  partition behavior, and Observability is explicitly evidence-only.
- The public release continues to ship dedicated
  `stackkits-modern-homelab` archives for Linux amd64/arm64, macOS
  amd64/arm64, and Windows amd64, plus Modern in the full StackKits bundle.

### Security

- Provider identities, credentials, endpoints, transport implementation,
  leases, server lifecycle, reverse tunnels, default routes, and general LAN
  authority cannot enter any of the five owner projections.
- Strict renderer decoding rejects extra fields and cross-owner authority;
  persisted-plan rebound rejects rehashed projection substitution.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview until its remaining publication, Cloud
  verification, backend Health, partition-enforcement, and live-evidence
  owners graduate.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Home internal-PKI runtime patch** that graduates the optional
> private TLS contract from generation-only to one authenticated authority-node
> owner without widening StackKits into certificate or infrastructure custody.

### Added

- One provider-free Product Runtime registration for the exact Home PKI
  authority node, bound to the generated artifact, Site, node, execution
  channel, request digest, and post-apply Health contract.
- Compiler-derived CA=false leaf identities carrying exact service, module,
  route, Site, node, subject, and DNS SAN authority.
- Separate root, leaf, public trust-distribution, and verification operations
  with fingerprint, public-key fingerprint, serial, validity, freshness, and
  trust-rotation continuity evidence.

### Changed

- Optional Home internal PKI is now `apply-ready`; its former unbound runtime
  owner is retired.
- Public trust-root distribution remains an exact compiler-owned Home
  Site/node target list while signing execution is restricted to the single
  explicit control-authority node.

### Security

- Root and leaf material, credentials, authenticated transport, endpoints,
  server providers, leases, and provider lifecycle remain construction-owned
  outside StackKits and cannot enter the generated policy or execution request.
- Ambiguous multi-controller CA authority continues to fail closed until a
  separate replicated/HA CA realization is defined.

### Known limitations

- Internal PKI remains optional and Home-only; it is not an implicit LAN
  discovery, public exposure, remote-access, or Cloud federation feature.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-07-24

> **Stable v0.x Modern Homelab execution-boundary patch** that keeps all three
> StackKit families in the public release while graduating one exact Home-side
> bridge runtime.

### Added

- A provider-free, authenticated Modern origin-mTLS Runtime owner with one
  hash-bound artifact and one local execution target per Home origin node.
- Explicit compiler-owned `{nodeRef, instanceRef}` pairs, preventing
  independently sorted node and backend-instance sets from changing custody.
- Fresh local proxy, certificate, configuration, and revocation readback
  evidence bound to the exact service, backend, transport, and identity policy.

### Changed

- Modern origin-mTLS is `apply-ready`; its former
  `runtime-owner-unbound` blocker is retired.
- Policy evaluation and operation observation use separate trusted timestamps,
  allowing credentials issued during binding while rejecting stale, future, or
  overlong claims.
- The public release continues to ship the dedicated
  `stackkits-modern-homelab` archives and the Modern definition in the full
  StackKits archive.

### Security

- StackKits owns no certificate/private-key bytes, signing authority, proxy
  implementation, Cloud-verifier readiness, endpoints, provider lifecycle,
  leases, reverse tunnel, or general LAN access.
- Bridge publication and backend Health remain independent fail-closed
  authorities and are not implicitly graduated by this release.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview until the separate publication, Cloud
  verification, backend Health, and live evidence owners graduate.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-07-23

> **Stable v0.x Home-PKI architecture patch** that makes the v2 trust boundary
> explicit without claiming certificate execution that is not yet bound.

### Changed

- Home internal PKI now binds exactly one Stack-scoped root-CA authority to the
  explicit single Home control member.
- Trust distribution carries only the public root to exact compiler-derived
  Home Site/node pairs, including multi-Home-Site topologies.
- Leaf issuance is a separate, explicitly unbound contract with
  compiler-derived service subjects and SANs, `CA=false`, bounded usages, and
  required fingerprint, serial, validity, and observation evidence.
- Internal-PKI artifacts no longer carry host roles, failure domains, hardware
  inventory, or a generic private-key slot for every target node.

### Security

- Multi-controller internal PKI fails closed until a distinct CA-authority and
  HA/replication realization is defined.
- Worker and trust-distribution targets cannot acquire CA signing custody.
- Runtime materialization, rotation, and verification remain blocked until
  exact root/leaf custody and fresh postcondition owners are implemented.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview. This patch changes its optional Home PKI
  contract but does not claim live provider/device compatibility or production
  federation.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-07-23

> **Stable v0.x Modern Homelab runtime-boundary patch** that ships Modern
> Homelab alongside Basement Kit and Cloud Kit and advances the provider-free
> Architecture-v2 execution handoff.

### Added

- Modern Homelab bridge-publication artifacts with an exact two-Site
  Home-to-Cloud projection and a dedicated outbound-only origin-mTLS executor
  contract.
- An authenticated public-TLS runtime owner with typed materialize, renew, and
  verify operations; external ACME credentials and certificate custody remain
  outside StackKits.
- Optional Home internal-PKI, local-autonomy, and access-executor handoffs with
  closed Site, node, route, capability, and evidence scope.

### Changed

- Basement Compose generation now receives only its narrow, hash-bound
  workload handoff instead of a wider resolved-plan projection.
- Modern Homelab remains a first-class release family with dedicated Linux,
  macOS, and Windows archives in addition to the full release bundle.
- Obsolete unbound TLS and origin-identity readiness states were removed once
  their exact runtime contracts became construction-owned.

### Security

- Modern origin transport is TLS 1.3, exact-SNI, outbound-only, and cannot
  grant general LAN, reverse-tunnel, signing-key, credential, provider, lease,
  or lifecycle authority.
- Public-TLS execution rejects stale or widened claims, credential material,
  provider fields, shell authority, route substitution, and certificate-slot
  substitution.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview. This release proves its public packaging and
  provider-free contract boundaries, not live provider/device compatibility
  or production federation.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-07-23

> **Stable v0.x architecture patch** that closes the Cloud network and
> offsite-backup renderer boundaries without adding provider authority.

### Changed

- Cloud and Modern public-edge artifacts now contain only their exact
  compiler-owned routes, origin/backend nodes, access/TLS/Health authority,
  and minimal network posture.
- Optional Cloud private-admin-mesh artifacts now contain only the selected
  private, device-bound, default-closed routes, exact Cloud Site/node scope,
  and minimal network posture.
- Home and Cloud offsite-backup artifacts now contain only their hash-bound
  target requirements and optional external custody bindings.

### Security

- Generic storage, data, failure, DNS, domain, gateway, MTU, local
  reachability, endpoint, credential, lease, provider lifecycle, and
  server-provider fields cannot cross these migrated renderer boundaries.
- Added fields, provider substitution, route/Health/Site/node widening,
  LAN step-down, malformed network posture, and backup requirement/binding
  substitution fail closed.

### Known limitations

- These contracts remain provider-neutral. Provider selection, provisioning,
  transport, credentials, leases, and target lifecycle stay in TechStack or
  another external authority.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-23

> **Stable v0.x patch** that publishes Modern Homelab as the third public
> StackKit family while preserving its honest Preview status.

### Added

- Dedicated Modern Homelab archives for Linux amd64/arm64, macOS amd64/arm64,
  and Windows amd64, alongside the full, Basement Kit, and Cloud Kit bundles.
- The public native-v2 Modern authority, two-Site initial-intent path, required
  federation contract, and archive-level semantic contract proof.

### Fixed

- Persisted canonical plans now decode integer health ports, timeouts, and
  expected HTTP status lists without weakening fractional-value rejection.
- Public affected CUE planning selects only roots present in the exported
  checkout while private source continues to cover every available kit root.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab remains Preview. Archive availability proves self-contained
  authoring and semantic contract validation, not completed live federation,
  runtime-owner graduation, provider compatibility, or production support.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence remains
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-22

> **Stable v0.x patch** for the provider-free RIL action handoff. This release
> adds an exact approval, execution, replay, and evidence boundary over the
> native Architecture-v2 plan without exposing provider lifecycle, raw host
> access, credentials, endpoints, or caller-selected commands.

### Added

- A CUE-governed catalog of seven closed RIL primitives with deterministic
  contract hashes, explicit approval and grant requirements, typed inputs,
  verification/recovery policy, and raw-authority prohibitions.
- The authenticated, tenant-isolated two-step StackKits delivery surface:
  `POST /api/v2/internal/ril-actions/resolve` binds the exact StackSpec and
  Inventory, while `POST /api/v2/internal/ril-actions/execute` accepts only the
  shared approved-action request and returns the shared redacted evidence.
- A persistence-neutral atomic execution-ledger contract with acquire, replay,
  in-progress, conflict, and token-fenced completion semantics. TechStack owns
  the durable Postgres/RLS implementation and outer dispatch custody.
- One deliberately read-only owner, `verify-stackkit-state`, which verifies
  the exact current governed plan and truthfully reports that no host/runtime
  state was observed.

### Security

- Requests with missing or expired approval/grants, stale or substituted
  plan/primitive/tenant/stack/target identity, conflicting replay, provider
  fields, raw SSH/Docker/OpenTofu authority, arbitrary paths, or caller
  commands fail before the governed owner.
- Internal resolution state is scoped by authenticated tenant plus Stack ID;
  the tenant scope cannot enter generated plans, action requests, evidence, or
  exported artifacts.

### Known limitations

- The remaining six primitives are `contract-only`. Mutating node owners,
  recovery execution, protected diagnostic retention, and product startup/API
  registration continue after this patch and do not silently fall back to v1.
- Candidate, device, provider, browser, and compatibility evidence is
  `pending/unverified` for this v0.x release. No pass is claimed; the publisher
  validates exact main, public export, archives, checksums, and release assets.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-22

> **Stable v0.x release** of the native Architecture-v2 line. Basement and
> Cloud use the same CUE-governed v2 identity from authoring through Apply;
> kit-specific topology, trust, ingress, backup, and runtime requirements stay
> explicit. Modern Homelab and adapters without concrete runtime evidence
> remain Preview or fail closed instead of falling back to v1 behavior.

### Highlights

- **Native v2 product path:** CLI, API, MCP, catalog, compiler, generators,
  artifacts, evidence, and governed executor handoffs bind exact v2 identities.
- **Three structural kit products:** Basement is Home-local, Cloud is
  Cloud-hosted, and Modern is Home-plus-Cloud federation. Multi-node does not
  select a kit, and High Availability remains an add-on.
- **Provider-free StackKits boundary:** external hosts, Cloud backup targets,
  Home encrypted backup targets, and federation access enter through opaque,
  hash-bound contracts. Provider lifecycle, credentials, leases, endpoints,
  and cleanup remain TechStack authority.
- **Fast beta operations:** v0.x publication validates source, public export,
  and release artifacts. Candidate, device, provider, browser, and
  compatibility evidence remains optional and is reported honestly when not
  supplied.

### Added

- Exact external Cloud and Home backup target bindings with customer/Home-held
  encryption authority, plaintext-egress denial, bounded freshness, and
  restore-verification requirements.
- Exact Modern federation and Home-access projections with typed blockers for
  missing or expired custody evidence and no general LAN or implicit transport
  fallback.
- Runtime adapter, workload, TLS, observability, backup, and executor-bundle
  contracts that remain fail closed until the responsible implementation and
  evidence are available.

### Changed

- New operational writes and rollout paths are v2-only. Legacy StackSpec v1 is
  limited to explicit read/migration compatibility and is no longer an
  operational fallback.
- Generated architecture authority, OpenAPI contracts, fixtures, and public
  export checks now track the same provider-neutral v2 source.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab, High Availability realizations, and runtime adapters still
  require their own implementation and fault evidence before graduation.
- Candidate E2E and compatibility evidence for this v0.x release is
  `pending/unverified`; no pass is claimed. Exact source/export/archive
  integrity is validated by the release workflow.

## [0.7.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-21

> **Prerelease** of the native Architecture-v2 line. Basement and Cloud now
> author, resolve, generate, inspect, and enter Apply through the same
> CUE-governed v2 identity without operational StackSpec-v1 or global-context
> fallback. Modern Homelab, HA realizations, external Home-access fabrics, and
> adapters without concrete evidence remain explicit Preview or fail-closed
> surfaces and do not become runtime-graduation claims.

### Highlights

- **One native v2 authority:** CLI, HTTP API, MCP, managed fetch, CAS storage,
  compiler, generators, evidence, and governed executors bind the same
  StackSpec, catalog, ResolvedPlan, artifact, and result identities.
- **Kit semantics are structural:** Basement and Cloud remain distinct
  single-Site/multi-node products over a shared foundation. Modern is the
  independent Home-plus-Cloud federation product; multi-node alone never
  selects it, and High Availability remains only an add-on.
- **Provider-free execution boundary:** StackKits consumes the merged shared
  `runtimeexecutor/v1beta1` contract while provider lifecycle, leases,
  credentials, endpoints, and cleanup remain TechStack authority.
- **Fast v0.x feedback:** normal development and publication use deterministic
  affected slices. Device, provider, browser, compatibility, and broad suites
  remain optional evidence rather than beta release gates.

### Added

- Exact StackInstance, Control Authority, multi-node, Fleet-isolation,
  device-bound identity, Home-access custody, host-conformance, route,
  federation, publication, data, failure, and executor-bundle contracts.
- Distinct Core, Basement-local, Cloud, workload, TLS, backup, observability,
  and Modern federation generation handoffs with typed readiness blockers.
- Canonical Apply requirements and evidence bounded by actual binding expiry,
  immutable artifact digests, one captured authorization instant, exact
  child-dispatch subsets, and adapter-declared access capabilities.

### Changed

- Operational StackSpec-v1 writers, mutators, runtime actions, setup/recovery
  paths, and remote transports are retired on v0.7. v1 remains only a
  read-only classification/validation and explicit migration input.
- The public OSS projection remains reproducible Basement/Cloud source. Private
  Modern authority, provider operations, credentials, and product-only
  surfaces are excluded structurally.

### Known limitations

- Modern Homelab and every HA realization remain Preview until their separate
  runtime and fault evidence exists.
- Optional external Home-access fabrics and runtime adapters without an exact
  registered implementation return typed blockers. No general LAN tunnel,
  provider lifecycle, or implicit fallback is introduced.
- Compatibility and Candidate evidence may remain `pending/unverified` for
  this v0.x prerelease; source and exported artifact integrity are still
  validated exactly.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-19

> **Stable** Architecture v2 contract release. This promotes the v0.6 line to
> the public `latest` while retaining the supported v1 Basement and Cloud
> rollout paths for the compatibility window. Architecture v2 remains
> deliberately fail-closed wherever a concrete renderer, executor, or runtime
> evidence contract is not implemented; this release does not claim Modern
> Homelab runtime graduation. The stable rollback baseline is `v0.5.2`.

### Highlights

- **Provider-free host admission is executable**: StackKits accepts an already
  supplied host only through an opaque, hash-bound `ExternalHostBinding` and
  produces a separate `HostConformanceReceipt`. Provider allocation, accounts,
  credentials, addresses, cleanup, and lifecycle remain outside StackKits.
- **Generation follows one governed v2 transaction**: current StackSpec and
  inventory are re-resolved, the exact plan is authorized, typed renderers run
  inside a held output root, and generated bytes, manifests, and receipts are
  verified before installation. Unsupported product slices stop before partial
  output or legacy fallback.
- **Home and Cloud trust are explicit kit contracts**: identity authorities,
  issuers, audiences, verifier placements, enrollment, and one-way verifier
  distribution are StackInstance-bound and kit-owned. Policy artifacts contain
  no credentials, signing keys, JWKS bytes, endpoints, or provider lifecycle
  data, and runtime enforcement remains evidence-blocked.
- **Kit identity is the architecture selector**: Basement, Cloud, and Modern
  Homelab now resolve their own CUE-owned capability plans. The legacy global
  `context` value no longer distinguishes products, and High Availability is
  an add-on with kit-specific realizations rather than a fourth kit.
- **Modern Homelab is the Home-plus-Cloud federation product**: Home authority,
  Cloud verifier placement, isolated publication, data authority, and
  partition behavior are modeled separately from multi-node topology. Modern
  remains Preview until its concrete bridge and runtime evidence graduate.

### Added

- Closed, compiler-owned projections and deterministic generation-only policy
  manifests for Home offline autonomy, local ingress/LAN access, optional LAN
  discovery, and Basement/Cloud/Modern identity trust.
- Provider-neutral host conformance observation and apply admission bound to
  the exact external-host binding and running StackKits binary.
- Governed Architecture v2 Runtime Action admission with an exact v2 envelope;
  provider, transport, and lifecycle verbs cannot enter the StackKits runtime
  boundary, and unimplemented execution ends at a typed fail-closed boundary.
- Explicit render instances, runtime-network instances, artifact ownership,
  current-resolution authorization, and concrete foundation/socket-proxy
  renderer contracts without inferring cardinality or node placement.

### Security

- Plans cannot self-authorize through copied labels or recomputed hashes: the
  service rebinds them to its frozen CUE definition and catalog and compares
  canonical bytes against a fresh resolution before generation or apply.
- Identity URNs, audiences, key-set references, host bindings, conformance
  receipts, artifacts, and execution receipts are bound to the exact Stack,
  plan, authority, and implementation inputs they protect.
- Home-to-Cloud verifier distribution is one-way and reference-only. Signing
  keys, credentials, Cloud-side device enrollment, reverse trust distribution,
  general LAN reachability, and provider lifecycle authority stay structurally
  unreachable.

### Compatibility

- Public compatibility claims are OS-only. Architecture, kernel, runtime,
  virtualization, device, lane, and provider facts remain private admission
  diagnostics and cannot become public support dimensions.
- Existing v0.5 StackSpec inputs remain readable for one minor compatibility
  window. New Architecture v2 plans use the governed contract and must be
  re-resolved when mandatory authority, instance, network, artifact, identity,
  or host-admission fields change.
- Basement and Cloud remain the supported rollout products. Modern Homelab is
  still Preview, and generation/apply readiness is reported per concrete
  implementation instead of being inferred from a kit name or release status.

## [0.6.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-16

> **Prerelease** of the StackKits Architecture v2 contract. This beta keeps the
> supported v1 Basement and Cloud rollout paths available while publishing the
> governed v2 resolve, migration, planning, and rendering authority for early
> integration. Architecture v2 generation and apply continue to fail closed
> where a concrete typed renderer or runtime-evidence implementation is still
> missing; this release does not claim Modern Homelab runtime graduation.

### Highlights

- **Kit identity is now architectural authority**: the admitted product
  definition selects its CUE-owned capability plan. The legacy global `context`
  value no longer decides which kit is being built.
- **Basement and Cloud share a contract spine without sharing deployment
  semantics**: Basement owns home-site, LAN, private-remote-access, and optional
  public-egress policies; Cloud owns cloud-site, private-admin-mesh, and public-
  edge policies. Both support explicit multi-node plans without redefining the
  product as a separate kit.
- **Architecture v2 is fail-closed and integration-ready**: immutable resolved
  plans bind product authority, inventory, modules, runtime networks, and owned
  artifacts; generation and apply reject missing concrete implementations
  instead of silently falling back to legacy behavior.
- **Modern Homelab is the local-plus-cloud federation product**: its contract
  requires explicit site federation, isolated bridge and publication policies,
  placement/data authority, and fail-closed partition behavior. It remains
  Preview until the concrete bridge renderer and real multi-site evidence pass.
- **High Availability remains an add-on**: `addons/ha` resolves kit- and mode-
  specific realizations; `legacy fourth-kit identifier` is rejected as a product identity and retained
  only as legacy migration material.

### Added

- A canonical Architecture v2 pipeline from StackSpec and inventory through a
  service-owned CUE definition/catalog to an immutable `ResolvedPlan`, explicit
  render instances, runtime-network instances, governed artifact ownership, and
  exact current-resolution authorization.
- CLI and API seams for fail-closed v1 migration and v2 resolution, including
  authority, catalog, plan, source, inventory, and artifact hashes consumed by
  generation and apply authorization.
- Definition-owned reachability, typed access policies, node and runtime-daemon
  placement, hardware eligibility, service endpoints, Modern publication/data
  boundaries, and device-enrollment contracts.
- A public-safe Architecture v2 projection for Basement and Cloud plus an
  isolated, non-product two-node contract fixture. Modern federation source and
  private product authority remain structurally outside the OSS export.

### Security

- Rendering is plan-pure and installation writes stay beneath a held output
  root; copied plans, forged authority, cross-kit substitution, widened routes,
  orphaned network bindings, and unapproved direct runtime sockets fail closed.
- Module versions are immutable: changed module contracts require a version
  advance, and the offline merge-base gate rejects in-place registry drift.
- The pre-beta fast path binds every public mutation to freshly fetched current
  `main` and reruns build/export/archive/public-policy validation. Optional
  signed Candidate evidence additionally binds its tool binaries, runtime, host
  identity, canonical PATH, operation ownership, cleanup proof, and phased
  receipts without becoming a prerelease prerequisite.

### Compatibility

- Provider smokes, the Proxmox OS matrix, released-content SK-S1, and browser
  evidence are advisory documentation lanes for this prerelease. Missing rows
  are published as `pending/unverified`; they do not delay the prerelease or
  become synthetic PASS results.
- Existing v0.5 StackSpec inputs remain readable for one minor compatibility
  window and can be projected through the migration seam; all newly persisted
  Architecture v2 plans use the governed contract and must be re-resolved when
  mandatory authority, instance, network, or artifact fields change.
- This prerelease publishes version-tagged artifacts without advancing the
  stable `latest` release or OCI tag. The stable rollback baseline remains
  `v0.5.2`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- **Managed Coolify rollout readiness** now waits for the Coolify API health
  endpoint before StackKit-owned platform apps are created or started. Fresh
  managed VPS rollouts no longer fail only because Coolify has started its
  containers but is still finishing API startup or migrations.
- **Runtime-action evidence tests** cover the Coolify readiness handoff so the
  TechStack integration path does not regress to a two-minute fixture timeout.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-07

> **Stable** Cloud Kit graduation release. Promotes the v0.5.1 line after the
> release-candidate gates passed from current source contents: SK-S1 Basement
> Fresh Ubuntu + browser evidence, SK-S2 managed `kombify.me`, and SK-S3
> provider custom-domain/BYO-domain. Becomes the public `latest`; rollback
> baseline stays `v0.5.0`.

### Highlights

- **Cloud Kit graduates to supported**: the managed `kombify.me` and custom
  domain Cloud Kit gates pass with real provider-backed installer evidence, not
  scaffolding-only contract artifacts.
- **Basement Kit browser evidence is owner-session aware**: local SK-S1 browser
  evidence now proves the Immich Owner session through `/api/users/me` before
  restoring the visible Photos route when demo-data seeding is disabled, avoiding
  false failures on local HTTP/OIDC discovery.
- **Release evidence is complete for the v0.5.1 promotion**: CI, security,
  SK-S1 browser/Fresh Ubuntu, SK-S2, and SK-S3 gates passed on the same release
  source commit.

### Fixed

- **SK-S1 browser capture** no longer accepts the Immich login route as Photos
  evidence, and it no longer blocks on visible seeded-photo text when the
  scenario intentionally runs with demo data disabled.
- **Local evidence wrapper** passes the retained Fresh VM Immich owner bootstrap
  password only through the process environment for browser verification; it is
  not written into evidence manifests or native command diagnostics.

## [0.5.1-beta.2] - 2026-06-30

> **Prerelease** — supersedes `v0.5.1-beta.1`. Same v0.5.1 content (universal
> security baseline, tiered HA add-on, three-kit lineup) plus a cloud-rollout fix.
> Does not change `latest` (stays `v0.5.0` stable).

### Fixed

- **Cloud rollout apt-lock wait**: `waitForRemotePackageManager` raised its SSH
  context (5m → 15m) above its in-script wait loop (6m → 12m) so the wait is no
  longer killed prematurely, and now outlasts cloud-VM cloud-init/unattended-
  upgrades holding the dpkg lock on first boot. Fixes SK-S2/SK-S3 Wait failing
  with "failed to install Docker: apt_wait timeout" on v0.5.1-beta.1.
- **Public mirror**: export `schemas/stackkit-rollout-event.schema.json` (linked
  from `docs/CLI.md`) so the public markdown-link check passes.

## [0.5.1-beta.1] - 2026-06-30

> **Prerelease** validating the Cloud Kit graduation gates and shipping the
> universal security baseline plus the tiered HA add-on. Does not change the
> public `latest` (stays `v0.5.0` stable). Rollback baseline stays `v0.4.4`.

### Highlights

- **Universal host security baseline**: the measured host baseline (UFW
  default-deny with SSH/HTTP/HTTPS allowed, fail2ban sshd jail, security-only
  unattended upgrades, sshd hardening, sysctl controls) is now a Foundation
  contract applied to **every kit** (Basement, Cloud, Modern Homelab) on a
  Linux/apt host — no longer `basement-kit` only. Documented in `base/security.cue`.
- **High Availability is now a node-gated add-on, not a kit.** `addons/ha` ships
  two tiers: `warm-standby` (>=2 nodes, restore-based, builds on `addons/backup`)
  and `quorum` (>=3 odd managers, etcd live-failover — the former HA-Kit body).
  HA Kit is retired from the marketed lineup and retained dormant.
- **Three-kit market lineup**: Basement (stable), Cloud (graduating), Modern
  Homelab (preview / early-access). Surfaced on the website and in ADR-0026.
- **Cloud Kit graduation**: SK-S2 (managed `kombify.me`) and SK-S3 (provider
  custom domain) cloud gates run against this prerelease with the universal
  baseline present; Cloud Kit graduates `scaffolding -> supported` when both
  pass from released contents.

### Changed

- `securityBaselineApplies` no longer restricts the baseline to `basement-kit`.
- The kombify.me/Komodo cloud verify path threads the detected homelab dir
  (cloud installs under `~/my-cloud-homelab`, not `~/my-homelab`).
- ADR-0026 amended: 3 marketed kits + HA overlay add-on + universal baseline.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-30

> **Stable** promotion of the v0.5 line — becomes the public `latest`. Promotes
> `v0.5.0-beta.2` after the Basement Kit gates passed from released contents.
> **Basement Kit is stable**; **Cloud Kit ships as scaffolding** and graduates in
> **v0.5.1** once its live cloud gates (SK-S2 managed `kombify.me`, SK-S3 provider
> custom domain) pass — those are blocked on a platform provider-entitlement gate
> in the Sim service, not on StackKits code. Rollback baseline stays `v0.4.4`
> (pin `STACKKIT_RELEASE_VERSION=v0.4.4`).

### Highlights

- **base-kit → base/ + basement-kit + cloud-kit derivation is GA for Basement**:
  the single `base-kit` is retired into the shared `base/` library (`#StackBase`);
  Basement Kit (`basement-kit`, local, `base.stackkit.cc`) is the verified stable
  single-environment product, Cloud Kit (`cloud-kit`, `cloud.stackkit.cc`) is the
  cloud profile (scaffolding). Forward-compat alias `base-kit → basement-kit`.
- The whole reader surface, planning (ROADMAP), Beads, workflows, OpenAPI, and
  release pipeline are consistent on the Basement/Cloud model.

### Verified

- Local SK-S1 (Basement, fresh Ubuntu/Docker) `prepare → init basement-kit →
  generate → apply → verify` green; **released-content SK-S1** green against the
  published v0.5.0-beta.2 installer (L3 apps as managed Coolify apps with external
  IDs/status); live-installer smoke green; `go test ./...`, `cue vet`,
  `goreleaser check`, `export-public.sh`, `gosec` all pass.

### Deferred to v0.5.1

- Cloud Kit graduation (SK-S2 / SK-S3 live gates) — blocked on the managed
  provider-entitlement gate in the deployed kombify-Simulate service.
- Embedded `registry_snapshot.json` kit-catalog admin-DB resync (non-functional;
  init/generate resolve kits via the filesystem).

## [0.5.0-beta.2] - 2026-06-29

> First **published** v0.5 prerelease. Supersedes the unpublished `v0.5.0-beta.1`
> candidate by completing the reader-facing, planning, and hygiene migration so
> the Basement/Cloud split is consistent everywhere. Rollback baseline stays
> `v0.4.4` (pin `STACKKIT_RELEASE_VERSION=v0.4.4`).

### Fixed

- **Website two-product surface is now reachable**: `/kits/basement` and
  `/kits/cloud` route to their detail pages (old `/kits/base` redirects to
  Basement), the nav lists both kits, and the home page reflects two kits over
  one base instead of "BaseKit is the only public OSS kit surface".
- **OSS contributor gate**: the public `CONTRIBUTING.md` Local Gate command no
  longer references the retired `base-kit/` directory.
- **backup-controller**: the `host_kind` CHECK constraint accepts `basement-kit`
  (the Go const inserts it), fixing a constraint that would reject valid rows.
- Cloud admin profiles (SK-S2 / SK-S3) now declare `cloud-kit`; the
  canonical-scenario parity test cross-checks the kit instead of hardcoding it.

### Changed

- **Documentation, planning, and contracts fully migrated** to Basement/Cloud:
  README, STATUS, CONCEPTS, the ROADMAP (v0.5.0 = Basement + Cloud Derivation),
  kit-taxonomy propagation, OpenAPI examples + website mirror, the agent-run
  manifest schema, `cue vet` command examples, and assorted runbooks/comments.
  The `base-kit` → `basement-kit` deprecation alias is preserved.
- Per-kit templates are generated from the canonical `foundation/templates/` source
  (`cmd/gen-kit-templates`, freshness-test guarded); `public/base` and
  `public/cloud` installers are generated from the canonical installers.
- Removed the orphaned, retired `release-please` config (publish-oss owns
  releases) and dead/vacuous test scaffolding.

### Verified

- Local SK-S1 (Basement, fresh Ubuntu via Docker) `prepare → init basement-kit →
  generate → apply → verify` is green ("Deployment is healthy"); `go test ./...`,
  `cue vet` (base/basement/cloud/modern/ha), `goreleaser check`,
  `export-public.sh`, and `gosec` all pass.

## [0.5.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-29

> This is a new, opt-in version — it does **not** overwrite the previous stable.
> **Rollback baseline:** `v0.4.4` (stable) remains the immutable previous version; pin
> `STACKKIT_RELEASE_VERSION=v0.4.4` to roll back. See the Rollback subsection below.

### Highlights

- **Basement Kit + Cloud Kit derivation**: the single `base-kit` is retired as a kit. Its shared ~90% core (the v5 stack schema `#StackBase`, the service catalog, defaults, and schema checks) now lives in the `base/` library, and two thin derived products are layered on top: **Basement Kit** (`basement-kit`, local, installer `base.stackkit.cc`) and **Cloud Kit** (`cloud-kit`, cloud, installer `cloud.stackkit.cc`), distinguished only by `context`. The taxonomy is recorded in ADR-0026.
- **Single maintained core**: shared work is developed once in `base/`; only per-scenario deltas split into the two kits. Cloud Kit is the cloud adaptation of Basement (`context cloud` + cloud-only extensions). Cloud Kit ≠ Modern Homelab (the hybrid kit), which stays separate.
- **Add-on compatibility metadata** (`#AddOnCompatibility.contexts/stackkits`) is now slated for engine enforcement so variant-only add-ons resolve only where valid.

### Changed

- **BREAKING — kit slugs**: `base-kit` is no longer an installable kit. Use `basement-kit` (local) or `cloud-kit` (cloud). The public installer `base.stackkit.cc` now installs Basement Kit; the new `cloud.stackkit.cc` installs Cloud Kit; `install.stackkit.cc` remains the generic CLI entry.
- **Forward-compatibility alias**: `stackkit init base-kit` and any `stackkit: base-kit` in an existing `stack-spec.yaml` are normalized to `basement-kit` with a deprecation warning, so pre-0.5 specs keep working.

### Migration & rollback

- **Upgrade**: re-run the installer (`curl -sSL https://base.stackkit.cc | sh`) to get Basement Kit, or `cloud.stackkit.cc` for Cloud Kit. Existing `base-kit` specs auto-normalize.
- **Rollback to the pre-change version**: the previous stable **`v0.4.4`** (and its archives) are unchanged and remain the supported rollback target. Pin it explicitly to stay on / return to the old single `base-kit`:

  ```bash
  STACKKIT_RELEASE_VERSION=v0.4.4 curl -sSL https://base.stackkit.cc | sh
  ```

  Because `v0.5.0-beta.1` is a distinct tag, no `v0.4.x` release or archive is overwritten; rollback is always available by pinning the previous version.

### Release gate

- **Met — Basement is release-ready:** `go test ./...` is green (44/0), the multi-kit release
  pipeline + both installers (`base.stackkit.cc`, `cloud.stackkit.cc`) landed, the goreleaser
  two-kit archive install-smoke passes (`stackkit init basement-kit`/`cloud-kit` → generate →
  context-correct tfvars), and the local **SK-S1 (Basement) Fresh-Ubuntu E2E** passes end-to-end
  (`init → generate → apply → verify`; deployed `StackKit: basement-kit`, all services healthy).
  A 12-agent adversarial pre-merge review confirmed the substance clean and its release-plumbing
  findings are fixed.
- **Deferred by design — Cloud is scaffolding:** Cloud Kit's live **SK-S3/SK-S2 (Cloud) gates**
  need a provider-leased custom domain and a managed `kombify.me` subdomain and are **not yet
  proven from released contents**. `cloud-kit` `init → generate` is verified, but its live cloud
  apply is not; the `cloud-kit` mode matrix marks every cell `scaffolding`, and `cloud.stackkit.cc`
  is experimental until those gates pass. Basement Kit carries the release; Cloud Kit graduates
  from scaffolding when its cloud E2E is green.

## [0.4.5-beta.1] - 2026-06-23

### Highlights

- **Custom-domain provider lease proof**: keeps SK-S3 on the canonical fresh provider-leased server path and validates the full Start, Wait, Verify, and Cleanup chain against the Sim/Lease API and Cloudflare DNS.
- **Coolify custom-domain routing**: hardens the generated Coolify proxy labels so BaseKit service routers win over fallback routers and request wildcard TLS coverage for custom-domain service hosts.
- **Deferred app readiness**: treats accepted on-demand platform apps as deferred public-readiness evidence while keeping running and required services in the public URL gate.

### Fixed

- **Coolify proxy reconciliation**: reconciles the Coolify Docker endpoint and generated router labels so the custom-domain path does not depend on host-side proxy shims.
- **Released evidence diagnostics**: emits failed scenario artifacts when public URL verification fails, preserving release-gate evidence instead of failing later without a scenario row.
- **Browser evidence setup**: completes PocketID consent during browser evidence capture so BaseKit owner/passkey setup proof remains end-to-end.

### Release Notes

- This is a pinned prerelease for official-installer verification of the current SK-S3 provider-lease and Coolify routing fixes. Install with `STACKKIT_RELEASE_VERSION=v0.4.5-beta.1`; unpinned official installers should remain on the latest stable release until released-content SK-S1, SK-S2, and SK-S3 pass for the new tag.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **SK-S3 release evidence import**: accepts run-scoped custom-domain Base Hub URLs such as `https://base.e2e-cd-<run>.kombify.pro` when they remain inside the expected `kombify.pro` zone.
- **SK-S3 scenario validator fixture**: updates the release artifact validator test fixture from the old bare/manual custom-domain model to the current bootstrapped provider-lease Coolify contract.

### Release Notes

- Supersedes `v0.4.3` for stable public testing because `v0.4.3` published successfully and the released-content matrix passed, but the evidence republish step still rejected valid SK-S3 dynamic Base Hub URLs.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Released-content preflight snapshots**: regenerates SK-S2/SK-S3 TFVars golden snapshots so the public preflight gate matches the bootstrapped provider-lease scenario contract.
- **Installer credential verification**: accepts the current installer `Login credentials:` output header while still requiring the expected admin email and password lines.

### Release Notes

- Supersedes `v0.4.2` for stable public testing because `v0.4.2` published successfully but its released-content matrix still exposed stale golden snapshots and legacy credential-header verification.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Stable E2E scenario contract**: aligns SK-S2 and SK-S3 with the supported bootstrapped BaseKit release path. SK-S2 remains the kombify.me Komodo provider-lease proof, and SK-S3 remains the custom-domain Coolify provider-lease proof with Cloudflare DNS and managed cleanup, but neither stable scenario claims the unsupported `advanced` or `bare` scaffolding path.
- **Released-content verify expectations**: updates the production verifier to require bootstrapped tfvars, Base Hub access summaries, public service URLs, DNS records, and Komodo/Coolify platform evidence from the official installer release.

### Release Notes

- Supersedes `v0.4.1` for stable public testing because `v0.4.1` published successfully but its released-content SK-S2/SK-S3 verify run exposed stale `advanced`/`bare` assertions.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-22

### Highlights

- **Stable BaseKit promotion**: promotes the `v0.4.0-beta.2` evidence set to the stable public installer path after SK-S1, SK-S2, SK-S3, SK-S5, browser evidence, public export, archive validation, SBOMs, and attestations passed.
- **Real ephemeral server E2E**: keeps SK-S2 and SK-S3 on fresh provider-leased servers through the Sim/Lease API, with SSH used only as transport and managed cleanup required for DNS records plus server leases.
- **Release evidence completeness**: the stable release carries canonical scenario rows and browser evidence instead of the earlier `v0.4.0` release's pending scenario rows.

### Fixed

- **Stable latest drift**: supersedes the older `v0.4.0` stable release evidence that still marked SK-S1/SK-S2/SK-S3/SK-S5 and browser gates as pending.
- **Roadmap and Beads state**: closes the v0.4 release-blocking tracker drift after public beta2 evidence and current main Scenario/Admin/PaaS/Runtime gates proved the BaseKit beta-hardening scope.
- **Installer semantics**: keeps prerelease pins explicit while the unpinned official installer resolves to the newest stable tag.

### Release Notes

- This is the release-ready stable BaseKit path for public testing through the official installers without a prerelease pin.
- `v0.5.0` remains the product-contract-complete follow-up for non-v0.4 scope such as native Vaultwarden Owner UX and broader Enterprise application-layer polish.

## [0.4.0-beta.2] - 2026-06-21

### Highlights

- **Ephemeral provider-server E2E contract**: SK-S3 now provisions a fresh provider-leased Ubuntu server through the Sim/Lease API, runs the custom-domain installer over provisioned SSH, captures state/evidence, and deletes the simulation/server during cleanup.
- **Uniform beta provider lane**: provider selection now uses `STACKKIT_E2E_SERVER_PROVIDER`, then `STACKKIT_E2E_CLOUD_NODE_ENGINE`, then `STACKKIT_TECHSTACK_LEASE_PROVIDER`, and finally `centron-managed`; beta providers remain `centron-managed` and `ionos-managed`.
- **Release cleanup discipline**: SK-S3 production workflow phases now preflight service auth, provider readiness, and Cloudflare DNS credentials, then run an `always()` cleanup phase that emits explicit diagnostics even when provisioning or verification fails.

### Fixed

- **BYO SSH blocker removed from canonical SK-S3**: fixed-host SSH is now an explicit local debug override via `STACKKIT_SK_S3_DEBUG_FIXED_SSH=1`, not release evidence or CI prerequisite material.
- **Scenario state and artifacts**: SK-S2/SK-S3 artifacts now record provider metadata, and SK-S3 staged state persists simulation ID, node ID, SSH material, public IP, service hosts, DNS zone, and provider for follow-up phases and cleanup.
- **Production workflow diagnostics**: isolated SK-S3 Wait/Verify/Cleanup phases skip cleanly when no Start state exists, while workflow jobs upload blocked/skipped diagnostics instead of failing later on missing artifacts.

### Release Notes

- This is the release-candidate lane for public BaseKit beta testing through a pinned prerelease: `STACKKIT_RELEASE_VERSION=v0.4.0-beta.2`.
- At prerelease publication time, unpinned installs stayed on the stable release path until released-content SK-S1, SK-S2, and SK-S3 evidence was clean.

## [0.4.0-beta.1] - 2026-06-21

### Highlights

- **Public BaseKit beta candidate**: ships the v0.4 BaseKit release candidate as a pinned prerelease for official-installer testing with `STACKKIT_RELEASE_VERSION=v0.4.0-beta.1`.
- **Released-content gates**: production workflows now include explicit released-installer SK-S1 coverage, scenario evidence import, and diagnostic artifacts for skipped SK-S2/SK-S3 paths.
- **Local E2E evidence**: the Docker Desktop Fresh Ubuntu SK-S1 gate is split into bounded Start, Wait, Verify, and browser-evidence phases under the 15-minute policy.

### Fixed

- **Public export manifest**: includes the homelab setup-action evidence scripts required by the public surface checker and release CI.
- **Prerelease installer semantics**: installer tests prove prereleases are used only when `STACKKIT_RELEASE_VERSION` pins the beta tag; unpinned installs remain on stable latest.
- **Release diagnostics**: skipped or blocked production scenarios now emit explicit diagnostics instead of failing later during artifact upload.

### Release Notes

- This is a BaseKit public beta prerelease, not stable GA. Do not promote unpinned `latest` until released-content SK-S1, SK-S2, and SK-S3 pass or the public beta scope is narrowed explicitly.
- Current broader scenario blockers are tracked separately: SK-S2 service-auth preflight and SK-S3 provider-lease/DNS prerequisites must pass before claiming multi-use-case beta readiness.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-08

### Highlights

- **Native MCP surface**: StackKits now publishes one user-facing `stackkit` MCP connection, with `stackkit-mcp` as the local adapter and `stackkit-server /mcp` as the protected durable endpoint after install.
- **TechStack rollout readiness**: release archives include the MCP/server pieces needed for kombify-TechStack managed installs, plus bounded MCP rollout and Fresh Ubuntu phase gates.
- **Agent discovery**: stackkit.cc now ships OpenMCP metadata, `llms.txt` updates, and installation-process guidance for local, SSH, and protected durable MCP paths.

### Fixed

- **OSS release hygiene**: the StackKits runtime-action wire contract is now local to this repo, so public release builds no longer depend on private private-source Go modules.
- **Release export**: the Docker image build no longer emits private module-auth configuration into the curated public release surface.
- **Local gates**: Beads sync, local build timing, website checks, MCP smoke tests, and timeout-budget checks are all bounded by the 15-minute command policy.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Public release hygiene**: the public StackKits release now stays on the curated OSS export surface and release checks reject development-only paths, private workflows, internal runbooks, and test fixtures before publish.
- **Release evidence**: package artifacts are included in build attestations and attestation verification retries handle GitHub propagation delay without hiding real failures.
- **Security gates**: Go vulnerability dependencies are updated for `golang.org/x/crypto`, `golang.org/x/net`, and related `golang.org/x` modules, with lint/static/security checks restored to a clean state.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-25

### Highlights

- **Canonical live scenarios**: release work now focuses on SK-S1 local Coolify, SK-S2 kombify.me Komodo, and SK-S3 custom-domain Coolify, with installer gates split into bounded Start/Wait/Verify phases.
- **Auth baseline**: BaseKit rollouts restore TinyAuth/PocketID provider registration and runtime checks so protected services expose PocketID login instead of falling back to password-only TinyAuth.
- **Coolify routing**: generated Coolify rollouts now bootstrap, reconcile, and route StackKit-owned services through the managed proxy with service hostnames such as `base`, `id`, `photos`, and `kuma`.

### Fixed

- **Coolify proxy recovery**: fallback and reconciliation logic now restores file-provider routing, dynamic config mounts, proxy TLS settings, service routes, host-gateway access, and same-file dynamic-config sync handling.
- **Cloudflare DNS-01**: custom-domain Coolify rollouts pass Cloudflare Global API Key credentials to Traefik as `CF_API_KEY` when `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL` is present, while scoped API tokens still use `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`.
- **Installer readiness**: live installer jobs hand off VM state before verification and wait for routed services/certificates in bounded phases instead of relying on a single long-running job.
- **Runtime metrics**: restore-drill host metrics preserve legitimate zero CPU values instead of dropping them as missing data.
- **Release preflight**: `scripts/release/basekit-live-preflight.ps1` now fails closed when `go`, `node`, `npm`, `cue`, actionlint, or release helper commands return a non-zero exit code.
- **Coolify endpoint contract**: generated BaseKit rollouts keep the persisted `.stackkit/platform.json` Coolify endpoint node-local at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, while bootstrap and readiness probes can use a separate endpoint reachable from remote Docker targets.
- **Archive validation**: release archive smoke validation now checks the current `coolify_platform_bootstrap` and `.stackkit/platform.json` contract from packaged contents instead of obsolete Coolify token API markers.
- **Release state**: STATUS and ROADMAP now treat `v0.3.1` as the next public patch candidate and keep old `v0.2.8` follow-ups as historical evidence rather than current release blockers.

### Release Notes

- `v0.3.1` is the next intended Public OSS patch release. `v0.3.0` was a private failed release attempt and is not treated as a public release.
- Production run `26420216004` on `f3419a54` was intentionally cancelled by operator request after API/Gateway, BaseKit preflight, Sim UI auth, and SK-S2 Start had passed. Complete SK-S1/SK-S2/SK-S3 end-to-end evidence should be rerun before making an Enterprise production-readiness claim.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-22 (private tag; not public OSS release)

> `v0.3.0` was tagged privately but did not complete the public publish path. Do not use it as public release evidence and do not retag it.

### Highlights

- **PaaS portfolio alignment**: Coolify remains the default PaaS, while Komodo is the production alternative for BaseKit rollouts. Dokploy remains draft until promoted.
- **Komodo no-UI path**: generated rollouts install Komodo Core, Periphery, and DB, create the initial admin/API key without UI, close registration, persist `.stackkit/platform.json`, and deploy StackKit-owned Compose bundles as Komodo Stack resources through the API.
- **Dokploy no-UI path**: generated rollouts set `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, create or confirm the first owner, establish a session, mint a non-rate-limited API key, persist both `token` and `apiKey`, deploy raw Compose resources through Dokploy, and route through `dokploy-traefik`.
- **Forge Map/Admin sync**: Admin seed and generated CUE now carry Coolify as the PaaS standard with Komodo as the production alternative; Dokploy is tracked as draft.

### Changed

- StackKit-owned L3 app deployment now has explicit selected-PaaS adapter contracts for Coolify and Komodo, with Dokploy kept behind draft adapter coverage.
- Production E2E coverage is capped at SK-S1 local Coolify, SK-S2 kombify.me Komodo, and SK-S3 custom-domain Coolify.
- Documentation, ADRs, StackSpec reference, website content, and Works-With metadata now describe the Coolify default, Komodo production alternative, and Dokploy draft status honestly.

### Fixed

- Dokploy Compose creation now persists `sourceType: raw` through a follow-up update before deploy, avoiding accidental GitHub-source deployments.
- Komodo adapter upserts now resolve canonical stack IDs on create conflicts before update/deploy evidence is recorded.
- Generated Admin/CUE artifacts are back in sync for `paas.type` and the production/draft PaaS split.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-05-17

### Highlights

- **BaseKit bootstrap-open Base Hub**: local `base.<domain>` stays reachable during first-run owner setup, shows an unprotected warning, and can be protected after PocketID/TinyAuth setup.
- **Registry-backed module release**: module release and verify now use service auth, bootstrap missing module rows through the Admin registry, and keep all 24 module contract hashes in strict parity.
- **Release gate stabilization**: AdGuard Home module tests wait for routed UI readiness after provisioning, and the module release command stays below lint complexity thresholds.

### Fixed

- Prevent stale service-catalog snapshots from re-protecting the local Base Hub by pinning `base` to identity `none` for local fallback defaults.
- Keep default L3/application services protected unless they are explicitly configured public; the Base Hub is the local onboarding exception only.
- Avoid browser-session Admin tokens in module release CI; signed service-auth requests now take precedence.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-05-17

### Highlights

- **BaseKit product-contract guardrails**: fresh Ubuntu evidence now checks protected/default anonymous rejection, node-local manifest visibility, and the Photos setup action instead of relying on container liveness only.
- **Release mirror hygiene**: the curated release export now ships a narrower documentation surface, a sanitized release roadmap, and root-relative website link validation for the Svelte/Vite site.
- **Agent and website surface**: stackkit.cc moved to the Svelte 5/Vite/Tailwind site while preserving installer routes, `llms.txt`, OpenAPI/schema mirrors, and prompt Markdown.

### Fixed

- Local website release gates now run `npm install`, `npm run check`, and `npm run build` without failing on Windows locked native modules from an existing `node_modules`.
- BaseKit docs now clarify that L3 public or unauthenticated exposure is allowed only through explicit access policy, never as the default.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- **StackKit standards**: codified release archives as the installable product boundary, requiring packaged `cue.mod`, shared `base/`, module contracts, packaged OpenTofu, and fresh-target archive validation for defaults.
- **Installer quality bar**: documented that public one-liner endpoints must return executable shell instead of website fallback HTML.
- **Public release helper**: hardened the public publish script around release deletion and release-existence checks.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **BaseKit release archives**: `stackkits` and `stackkits-base-kit` archives now include root `cue.mod/**` and `modules/**`, allowing installed BaseKit definitions to run composition and generate TinyAuth credentials for the one-line installer path.
- **Release validation**: the public release workflow now extracts the BaseKit archive and verifies `init` plus `generate` from released files so archive packaging regressions fail before publish.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Runtime image build**: Dockerfile now uses Go 1.26.3 so the public StackKit server image build matches `go.mod` and can publish `ghcr.io/kombifyio/stackkits`.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-13

### Highlights

- **PaaS app handoff path**: BaseKit can persist optional user app handoff metadata into the stack spec, register kombify.me app service names, and expose platform app handoff state in `stackkit status --json`.
- **Runtime action bridge**: `stackkit-server` now exposes service-auth-protected internal runtime actions for TechStack-managed rollout, verification, and restore-drill handoffs with dry-run-by-default execution.
- **Scenario evidence**: SK-S2A and SK-S3A scenario definitions, golden fixtures, docs, and the public SvelteKit smoke app example are included for dev-only PaaS handoff validation.

### Added

- `stackkit app add` command coverage for SvelteKit app definitions, route defaults, env values, and secret references.
- Dev-gated base installer app handoff environment variables for local handoff validation.
- Internal service-auth JWT verification with current/next secret rotation support for runtime action callbacks.

### Changed

- App-enabled StackSpecs now generate PaaS handoff manifests without making StackKit responsible for user app deployment.
- Public export manifest includes the SvelteKit smoke example used by dev handoff validation.

## Historical — kit-update-phase-1: Base Kit Update-Lifecycle (Foundation + CLI)

> **Not an unreleased section.** This block documents the kit-update-lifecycle
> foundation that landed during the 0.3.x development cycle and is **LIVE**
> (production milestone 2026-05-08; migrations 000107–000109 on Render). It is
> retained below the `[0.2.3]` entry for historical continuity and is out of
> strict Keep-a-Changelog order by intent — the version headers above are the
> canonical release record. Do not treat it as pending work.

### Production milestone (2026-05-08) — Phase 1 LIVE

- DB Migrations 000107–000109 (renumbered from initial 000090–000092 drafts because slots 000086–000106 were claimed by other repos before apply) **LIVE on Render** `kombify-stackkits` Postgres: `release_channel` columns, `sk_node_deployment` mirror, `sk_kit_module_compat` resolver view.
- ADR-0018 implementation-status table updated: DB migrations + Admin (channel-promotion endpoints, resolver, node-deployments, UI) marked ✅ Shipped. Lessons-learned section added (sqlc-000106-fix, 000067-replay-fix, GO_VERSION 1.26.3 bump, renumbering rationale, best-effort PATCH note).
- North-Star reference doc the private kit update lifecycle doc — canonical landing page for the update lifecycle (TL;DR, diagram, three pillars, surfaces, phase roadmap, operator quick-start, cross-repo surfaces, architectural invariants). Linked from the public repository.

### Added

- **Tests/Release**: BaseKit live preflight (`scripts/release/basekit-live-preflight.ps1`), release-note parser tests, public export validation, website changelog smoke, and `production-tests.yml` inputs for the first SK-S1 fresh Ubuntu live run.
- Node Hub service-guide metadata in CUE, registry, and generated catalog paths; the generated `base.<domain>` dashboard now starts with Getting Started, important links, and a compact enabled-service matrix with public Mintlify how-to links.
- ADR-0018 — Kit-Update-Lifecycle (Channels, Atomic-Snapshot, Compatibility-Resolver). See the private ADR-0018 record.
- Kit-update design consolidated into ADR-0018, the private kit update lifecycle doc, and the operator runbooks.
- CUE — `#ToolType` (`oss`/`managed`/`hybrid`) + `#ToolCategory` (curated 18-Set) in `base/tool_categorization.cue`.
- CUE — `#IaCDefaults` schema (`provider_versions`, `default_tags`, `backend`) in `base/iac-defaults.cue`.
- IaC — Shared `iac/defaults/` module (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `README.md`) — kits import as `module "defaults"` and consume `module.defaults.tags`.
- Go — `internal/snapshot/` package: `Kopia` CLI wrapper (`kopia.go`) + `AtomicSnapshotter` orchestrating Kopia + tfstate copy + manifest.yaml (`atomic.go`). `ErrKopiaNotConfigured` is the canonical pre-flight failure.
- Go — `internal/registry/channel_resolver.go` — client for `/api/v1/sk/compat/resolve` with `ResolveResult.SummarizeReasons()` helper.
- CLI — `stackkit kit upgrade` (`cmd/stackkit/commands/kit_upgrade.go`) with flags `--to`, `--kit-channel`, `--module-channel`, `--allow-channel-mismatch`, `--dry-run`, `--auto-approve`, `--volumes`, `--snapshot-id`, `--endpoint`, `--token`. Pre-flight Kopia + resolver call + tofu plan + atomic-snapshot + tofu apply + admin PATCH (best-effort).
- CLI — `stackkit kit upgrade rollback` (`cmd/stackkit/commands/kit_upgrade_rollback.go`) with flags `--to-snapshot`, `--auto-approve`, `--skip-volume-restore`, `--kopia-restore-only`. Restores tfstate + Kopia volumes from a previous atomic-snapshot.
- CLI — `stackkit doctor --check-updates` — queries the Admin API for newer kit-versions in the current channel; appends `updates` and `updates-cta` rows to the doctor report. Network/admin failures degrade to `warn`, never `fail`.
- Schema — `pkg/models/DeploymentState` gains additive `KitVersionID`, `KitSemver`, `KitChannel`, `LastSnapshotDir` fields (all `omitempty`); state files written by older CLI versions still load.
- Operator runbooks — the private kit-upgrade runbook + the private kit-rollback runbook: pre-flight checklists, common flows, failure modes, timing expectations, manual recovery for kit-rollback.
- DB migrations (LIVE; in `kombify-DB/migrations/`):
  - `000107_sk_release_channels` — dual-level `release_channel` + `released_at` on `sk_stackkit` + `sk_module_version`, AFTER triggers for `action='channel_promote'`, a `target_kind` column on `sk_stackkit_audit_log`, and an inline backfill of existing versions to `stable`.
  - `000108_sk_node_deployment` — server-side mirror `(tenant_id, node_name) → (kit_slug, kit_version, kit_channel, module_versions, kopia_snapshot_id, tofu_state_path, status)`.
  - `000109_sk_compatibility_resolver_view` — VIEW `sk_kit_module_compat` as the resolver source.
- Tests — 48 new test cases (`internal/snapshot/`, `internal/registry/`, `cmd/stackkit/commands/kit_upgrade*`, `cmd/stackkit/commands/doctor_update*`); whole repo suite (30 packages) green.

### Pending (later in this phase)

- Admin: channel-promotion endpoints + resolver endpoint + node-deployments + UI pages shipped in kombify-Administration.
- Raise test coverage for update paths to 50% (T7).
- VM smoke test v1.0→v1.1 plus rollback (T9).
- Out-of-scope: Multi-Node-Rolling-Update (kit-update-phase-2), Auto-Promotion (kit-update-phase-3).

### Notes

- A Kopia repository becomes a mandatory update prerequisite: the operator must run `stackkit backup configure` before `stackkit kit upgrade` is admitted (ADR-0018 §3).
- Multi-node rolling updates explicitly belong to kit-update-phase-2, not Phase 1.
- Auto-promotion (edge → beta → stable via demand signal) explicitly belongs to kit-update-phase-3.

## Historical — Phase 1: Owner & Break-Glass Provisioning

> **Not an unreleased section.** This block documents the Owner & Break-Glass
> provisioning work that landed during the 0.3.x development cycle and is
> **LIVE**. It is retained here for historical continuity and is out of strict
> Keep-a-Changelog order by intent — the version headers above are the canonical
> release record. Do not treat it as pending work.

### Added

- `stackkit init` flags for owner provisioning:
  - `--cluster-mode={first|join}` (Phase 1: only `first` supported)
  - `--owner-source={local|cloud}` (Phase 1: only `local` supported; `cloud` errors with Phase-2 message)
  - `--owner-email`, `--owner-username`, `--owner-display-name`
  - `--recovery-passphrase-hash` (argon2id PHC; if missing, prompts interactively)
  - `--cloud-oidc-{issuer,client-id,client-secret-ref,foreign-subject}` (Phase 2 stubs)
- Per-node break-glass PocketID admin (`bg-{nodename}@local`) auto-generated during `stackkit apply`.
- Per-node TinyAuth static-cred (`bg-{nodename}-static`) as Layer-2 fallback for PocketID-down recovery.
- Encrypted recovery bundle in `/var/lib/stackkit/recovery/break-glass-{nodename}.age` (age-scrypt encryption with the user's recovery passphrase; default scrypt N=2^17, r=8, p=1).
- Plaintext convenience bundle next to the encrypted one (`.txt`, mode 0600, root-only).
- `stackkit break-glass list` / `show-bundle` / `rotate` (Phase-5 stub) sub-commands.
- PocketID `STATIC_API_KEY` lifecycle: generated by `stackkit init`, persisted in `<homelab>/.stackkit/pocketid-static-api-key` (mode 0600), wired into the pocketid container as `STATIC_API_KEY` env var via Terraform var.

### Changed

- CUE schemas:
  - `base/identity.cue` — added `#PocketIDOwner` (passkey-only; `source: local|cloud` with conditional required fields), `#TinyAuthStaticCred`.
  - `base/break-glass.cue` (new) — `#PocketIDBreakGlass`, `#BreakGlassBundle`, `#BundleContents`, `#BundlePayload`.
  - `base/cluster.cue` (new) — `#ClusterMode` stub for Phase 4.
- PocketID image pinned to `ghcr.io/pocket-id/pocket-id:v2` (currently v2.6.2). PocketID v2 is passkey-only — there is no password-based authentication.

### Out of Scope (later phases)

- `--owner-source=cloud` and Cloud-OIDC upstream (Phase 2)
- TechStack-bootstrap-token API + wallet integration (Phase 3)
- Multi-node cluster join / `stackkit cluster join-token` (Phase 4)
- `stackkit break-glass rotate` real implementation, audit logs, auto-rotation (Phase 5)

See ADR-0018, the private kit update lifecycle doc, and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the current roadmap.
